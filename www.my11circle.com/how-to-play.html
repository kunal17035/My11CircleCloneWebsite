			<p>The 11 players should include batsmen, wicketkeeper, bowlers, and all-rounders. Pick two players to be the captain and vice-captain of your team. Choose them wisely - they can multiply your points, increasing your score.</p>
			<h4>What are the rules to create a playing 11?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>You need to create your fantasy team using 100 credit points only</li>
				<li>You cannot choose more than 10 players from a team</li>
				<li>You have to pick all the skills (batsmen, all-rounder, bowler) for a team</li>
				<li>After selecting a team of 11, you have to choose a Captain and Vice-Captain</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>What is the importance of a captain and vice-captain?</h4>
			<p>Choose the best players as the captain and vice-captain for your team. While the captain bags 2X score (twice the points earned) of his performance, the vice-captain earns 1.5X score (one and a half times the points earned). Select players you think will perform well and gain you bonus points.</p>
			<h4>How to calculate the points in Fantasy Cricket</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Each player in fantasy cricket gets 4 points each for being a part of team 11.</li>
				<li>Captain gets 2X points</li>
				<li>Vice-captain gets 1.5X points</li>
				<li>No points are allocated to a player during a Super Over</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Bonus points are awarded on:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Boundary</li>
				<li>Half-century</li>
				<li>Century</li>
				<li>Economy rate</li>
				<li>Strike rate</li>
				<li>LBW/Bowled Wicket</li>
				<li>If a player converts his half century to a complete century, then points are allocated for full century only.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Points are deducted when:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Player’s strike rate is below 50 in ODI and 70 in T20</li>
				<li>Player’s economy rate is above 7 RPO in ODI and 10 in T20</li>
				<li>No points are deducted if your bowler is dismissed for a duck.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Understanding the Points System in Fantasy Cricket</h4>
			<h4 style="margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1;">New Points System</h4>
			<p style="margin:0px 0px 15px 0px;">(will be applicable from 4<sup>th</sup> March, 2023)</p>
			<p>Let’s take the example of the First T20 between India and Sri Lanka that was played on January 3, 2023 to understand the new points system:</p>
			<table class="table table-bordered">
				<tr>
					<th width="200">Player</th>
					<th width="150">Points</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Ishan Kishan (C)</td>
					<td>116</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Shubhman Gill</td>
					<td>10</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Deepak Hooda (VC)</td>
					<td>102</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Wanindu Hasaranga</td>
					<td>61</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Ishan Kishan is assigned as the captain, meaning his points (58) are doubled. He earned 37 points from 37 runs scored, 3 bonus points for scoring 3 fours and 4 bonus points for 2 sixes. His strike rate was 127.59 and hence no points scored for it. He took one catch to earn 8 points from it and was involved in an indirect run out which earned him a further 6 points making his total to 58 points.</p>
			<p>Deepak Hooda is assigned as the vice captain, meaning his points (68) are counted as 1.5x. He scored 41 runs earning him 41 points, with 1 four and 4 sixes earning him 1 and 8 bonus respectively. His striker rate was 178.26 earning him a bonus of 6 points. He was involved in run outs twice with other players involved hence earning a bonus of 12 points. Thus, his total points come out to be 68.</p>
			<h4>Old Points System</h4>
			<p>In Fantasy Cricket, points are scored by each player as per their performance in the live match. Let’s take the example of the fifth ODI between India and West Indies that was played on November 1, 2018.</p>

He earned 48 points for his 4 wickets, 2 bonus points for 4-wicket haul, 2 points for being in the playing 11, 2 points for a maiden over, and 2 bonus points for maintaining an economy between 3 and 4.5.</p>

			<p>Virat Kohli scored 33 runs off 29 balls, including 6 fours. He earned 16.5 points for his 33 runs, 3 bonus points for 6 fours, 1 bonus point for maintaining a strike rate between 100 and 149.9, and 2 points for being in the playing 11.

			<p>Choose the best players as the captain and vice-captain for your team. While the captain bags 2x score (twice the points earned) of his performance, the vice-captain earns 1.5x score (one and a half times the points earned). Select players you think will perform well and gain you bonus points.</p>
			<h4>Points are awarded for:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>Points scored</li>
			<li>Assists</li>
			<li>Blocks</li>
			<li>Rebounds</li>
			<li>Steal</li>
			<li>3 Pointer</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Points are deducted for:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Turnover</li>
			<li>Personal Foul</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To understand the points scoring in detail, visit the <a href="points-system.html">Points Scoring</a> section for Basketball.</p>
			<h4>Understanding the Points System in fantasy Basketball</h4>
			<p>In Fantasy Basketball, points are scored by each player as per their performances in the live match. Let’s take an example of the match between the Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics</p>
			
			<table class="table table-bordered">
		<tr>
		  <th width="200">Player</th>
		  <th width="150">Points</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Stephen Curry (C)</td>
		  <td>357</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Andrew Wiggins</td>
		  <td>114.5</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Klay Thompson</td>
		  <td>69</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Otto porter Jr</td>
		  <td>72</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Jaylene Brown (VC)</td>
		  <td>216.7</td>

		  <td>Derrick White</td>
		  <td>79.5</td>

		<tr>
		  <td>Marcus Smart</td>
		  <td>114.5</td>
		</tr>
		 </table>
			
		<p>Stephen Curry is assigned as a captain, meaning his points (178.5) are doubled (357).</p>
			<ul>
			<li>He Scored 34 points &#8594; 102 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 4 rebounds &#8594; 17.5 pts.</li>
			<li>He made 5 assists &#8594; 25 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 3 steals &#8594; 30 pts.</li>
			<li>He made zero successful blocks &#8594; 0 pts.</li>
			<li>He had zero turnovers &#8594; 0 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 3 personal fouls &#8594;  -3 pts.</li>
			<li>He made 7 3-pointers &#8594; 7 pts.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Jaylene is assigned as a vice-captain, meaning his points (114.5) are multiplied 1.5 times:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>He Scored 24 points &#8594; 72 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 7 rebounds &#8594; 24.5 pts.</li>
			<li>He made 5 assists &#8594; 25 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 2 steals &#8594; 20 pts.</li>
			<li>He made 1 successful blocks &#8594; 10 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 4 turnovers &#8594;  -8 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 1 personal fouls &#8594;  -1 pts.</li>
			<li>He made 2 3-pointers &#8594; 2 pts.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Klay Thompson is neither a captain nor a vice-captain, so his points remain the same as his actual score:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>He Scored 15 points &#8594; 45 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 2 rebounds &#8594; 7 pts.</li>
			<li>He made 3 assists &#8594; 15 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 0 steals &#8594; 0 pts.</li>
			<li>He made 0 successful blocks &#8594; 0 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 0 turnovers &#8594; 0 pts.</li>
			<li>He had 0 personal fouls &#8594; 0 pts.</li>
			<li>He made 2 3-pointers &#8594; 2 pts.</li>
			</ul>

	<h4>After the Match Ends</h4>	
	<p>You will find the final score and rank of your team in the Completed tab. The winning positions are announced as per the ranks of different teams. These ranks are finalised based on the points accumulated by the joined teams as per the player's performances in live matches. Let’s understand this better with an example:</p>
		<p><strong>Consider the following contest details:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Total winnings - ₹3,00,000</li>
			<li>Contest Size - ₹ 200</li>
			<li>Winners - ₹ 100</li>
			<li>Entry Fee - ₹ 2000</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Prize break-up:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rank 1: ₹ 1,00,000</li>
			<li>Rank 2: ₹ 60,000</li>
			<li>Rank 3: ₹ 20,000</li>
			<li>Rank 4-10: ₹ 5,000</li>
			<li>Rank 11-100: ₹ 1,000</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once the deadline for joining for a contest is over, the prize break-up is calculated again. This calculation is based on the actual number of teams who joined the contest. These teams will have a fixed rank on the basis of the points accumulated.</p>
		<p>So, if you participated in the contest and your team achieved a rank between 1 and 100, you win. The amount corresponding to your rank is your winning amount. The cash prizes, however, are different for different contests. The amount you win will reflect in your account after 4 hours.</p>
		<h3>Step 7. Withdraw Cash</h3>
		<p>To withdraw your winnings, go to your account on My11Circle and withdraw your cash directly into your bank account.</p>

		<h2>Glossary:</h2>
		<h3>Total winnings</h3>
		<p>Total winnings for a particular contest is the total pool amount that is distributed among the winners who are finalised on the basis of their rankings.</p>
		<h3>Winners</h3>
		<p>This is the total number of proposed winners in a contest.</p>
		<h3>Entry fee</h3>
		<p>This is the entry fee which needs to be paid to join a contest. The entry fee can be cash, ticket, or free.</p>
		<h3>Prize breakup</h3>
		<p>This is the prize that is distributed depending on the ranks achieved by the teams. Once a match goes live, the prize breakup is updated based on the number of teams that have joined the contest.</p>
		<h3>Teams joined/Contest size</h3>
		<p>This indicates the number of teams that have joined the contest on a real time basis, also displaying the maximum number of teams allowed to join the contest.</p>
		<h3>'G' - Guaranteed symbol</h3>
		<p>This symbol indicates whether a contest is guaranteed or not. If a contest is guaranteed, it means that the prize for a particular rank is guaranteed, although the number of prizes vary as and when more teams join the contest.</p>
		<h3>Beat the Expert Contest:</h3>
		<p>My11Circle has taken on board Sourav Ganguly, the Dada of Indian Cricket and Shane Watson, former Australian captain. They invite you to challenge them in the Beat The Expert (BTE) contest. And if you beat them, you win X times the entry fee. This X multiplier value might change from league to league or match to match. For example, during The Cricket World Cup 2019, we paid 5 times the entry fee as prizes to everyone who beat Dada in the Beat the Expert contest in every match.</p>
		<h3>Head to Head (H2H) Contest:</h3>
		<p>There are particular tournaments where you can compete with other like-minded Fantasy Sports fans on a one-on-one basis. Pick the prize amount you prefer and join the contest by paying the entry fee. This is a great way to challenge your opponent in a small, limited setup.</p>
		<h3>Abandoned Match:</h3>
		<p>If weather conditions or unforeseen events prevent a Cricket or Football match from starting, then it is termed as abandoned. In Cricket, when a bowler has not started his run up and the officials call for the game to be abandoned then it is called 'abandoned without a ball being bowled'.</p>
		<h3>Duck:</h3>
		<p>When a batsman gets out for zero runs, it is called a duck.</p>
		<h3>Maiden Over:</h3>
		<p>It refers to an over that has six deliveries and zero runs.</p>
		<h3>Decision Review System (DRS):</h3>
		<p>It is the technology used to assist the match officials such as the third umpire in making the right decision.</p>
		<h3>Washout Match:</h3>
		<p>If a match is cancelled due to the weather such as rain, after playing for a short while or no play then it is known as a washout match.
