At whose expense she plays is a question that will be answered only at the toss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for India<\/strong>: Smriti Mandhana, Shafali Verma, Sabbhineni Meghana, Yastika Bhatia (wk), Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Jemimah Rodrigues\/Pooja Vastrakar, Deepti Sharma, Radha Yadav, Sneh Rana, Meghna Singh, Renuka Singh<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Barbados<\/strong>: Deandra Dottin, Hayley Matthews (c), Kycia Knight (wk), Kyshona Knight, Aaliyah Alleyne, Trishan Holder, Alisa Scantlebury, Shakera Selman, Shamilia Connell, Keila Elliott, Shanika Bruce<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Players for the Match<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the start of the My11Circle Women\u2019s T20 Challenge, <strong>Harmanpreet Kaur<\/strong> has two fifties and four thirties in seven T20 innings. In the only game she has batted in the tournament, she blasted 52 off 34 against the mighty Aussies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same tournament, <strong>Hayley Matthews<\/strong> took four wickets and registered scores of 18 and 27. Overall, in her last nine competitive T20 innings, she has scored three fifties and three twenties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smriti Mandhana<\/strong> has been on a roll of late. Her last four T20I scores read 39, 22, 24, and 63*. Her approach has been simple: attack right from the word go. There are some bonus fantasy points for a healthy strike rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also Read:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/west-indies-vs-india-3rd-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\">West Indies vs India, 3rd T20I: Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/pros-and-cons-of-creating-multiple-fantasy-cricket-teams\/\">Pros and Cons of Creating Multiple Fantasy Cricket Teams<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks for the Match <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On her day, <strong>Kycia Knight<\/strong> is the most gifted batter on the field. On other days, she does not disturb the scoreboard. Her unbeaten 62 against Pakistan was a teaser of what she can do with the bat. It won\u2019t be as easy against India, but putting a price on her wicket should help her lay the foundation for a good innings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With five wickets in two games, <strong>Renuka Singh<\/strong> is the highest wicket-taker of the tournament. In her last five white-ball games, she has taken 12 wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pooja Vastrakar<\/strong> has taken 12 wickets in her last 10 competitive games, including a four-wicket haul in My11Circle Women\u2019s T20 Challenge. With the bat, she has played a few heroic innings for India, rescuing them from difficult situations. Her strike rate reads 131 in the format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deandra Dottin<\/strong> now has four consecutive scores of 8, but she has been making amends with the ball. In the last five professional T20 games, she has managed six wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spin duo of <strong>Radha Yadav<\/strong> and <strong>Sneh Rana<\/strong> took four wickets between them against Pakistan. The pitch at Edgbaston has become more effective for the spinners with every passing gameMoreover, the duo can score handy runs down the order and that too at a brisk rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her last five white-ball games, <strong>Shafali Varma<\/strong> has one fifty, two forties, and a thirty. Against Pakistan, she added another layer to her talent, taking her maiden international wicket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The responsibility of bowling with the new and old ball is on <strong>Shamilia Connell<\/strong>. Her best figures read 3 for 14 in the format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong> India Women vs Barbados Women Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although India lost to Australia, they put their best foot forward. Against Pakistan, they made it look easy. On the other hand, Barbados have punched well above their weight to register one win in two games, despite being thin on experience and numbers. All in all, considering the team combinations and form, India seem to be ahead in the race.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7555\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
