He has collected 245 runs and picked 19 wickets against the West Indies in T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With scores of 61, 62, and 61 in his last three T20Is, <strong>Nicholas Pooran<\/strong> will be the biggest threat to Bangladesh. He could also generate fantasy points through his wicketkeeping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rovman Powell<\/strong> too has been in good form lately. He has scored 242 runs, including a century in his last 6 T20Is. In addition to his big-hitting, he is also a neat catcher, especially in the deep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mustafizur Rahman<\/strong> enjoys bowling against the West Indies in T20Is. In only 7 outings, he has bagged 15 wickets against them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alzarri Joseph <\/strong>was the leading wickettaker (12) in two Tests and will lead the pace attack for West Indies. His ability to move the ball late can create problems for Bangladesh all over again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to keeping wickets, <strong>Litton Das<\/strong> is also expected to open the batting and go hammer and tongs in the powerplay. He has scored 239 runs at 34 against the West Indies in the format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nasum Ahmed<\/strong> might be new to international cricket, but he has already made an impact by regularly striking in the powerplay. He has bagged 14 wickets in his last 10 T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we saw in the Tests, <strong>Mehidy Hasan<\/strong> will generate fantasy points with both bat and ball. Besides bowling in the powerplay, he can also be promoted up the order in pursuit of quick runs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After smashing 146 in the second Test, <strong>Kyle Mayers<\/strong> would be keen on carrying his rich form onto the T20s as well. He is likely to open the batting and has a reputation for breaking partnerships with the ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Akeal Hosein<\/strong> will lead the spin attack for the hosts. His ability to strike with the new ball in the powerplay has often rewarded fantasy players in the past.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>West Indies have a super effective bowler at the death in <strong>Obed McCoy<\/strong>. In his recent English domestic T20 stint, he managed to pick 14 scalps in five games.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both teams have locked horns 13 times, out of which West Indies have won 7 and Bangladesh 5. Although the tourists were whitewashed in the Tests, they will fancy their chances in the T20 format. Their crafty spinners can cause plenty of problems for the hosts on the dry wickets of the Caribbean.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New to fantasy cricket?\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/\">Learn about what is fantasy cricket.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 2 July, 11.00 PM IST<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7033\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
