Given Punjab have power-hitters in their top order, Rohit Sharma will need to strengthen his bowling attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/cricket-teams\/mumbai-team\/\">Mumbai<\/a><\/strong>: Rohit Sharma (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Dewald Brevis*, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Kieron Pollard*, Ramandeep Singh\/Tymal Mills*, Murugan Ashwin, Jaydev Unadkat, Jasprit Bumrah, Basil Thampi\/Riley Meredith*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barring his 25* in the opening game, Odean Smith hasn\u2019t lived up to the hype. The English all-rounder Benny Howell is likely to make his debut.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/cricket-teams\/punjab-team\/\">Punjab<\/a><\/strong>: Mayank Agarwal (c), Shikhar Dhawan, Liam Livingstone*, Jonny Bairstow* (wk), Jitesh Sharma, Shahrukh Khan, Benny Howell*, Kagiso Rabada*, Rahul Chahar, Vaibhav Arora, Arshdeep Singh<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players for Mumbai vs Punjab Match<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Suryakumar Yadav<\/span> has read the Pune wicket well. His innings of 68* off 37 against Bangalore was laced with five fours and six sixes. Before that, he had scored 52 off 36 against Kolkata at the same venue. Based on his recent form and numbers at Pune, he is the safest pick for captaincy or vice-captaincy in fantasy cricket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Liam Livingstone<\/span> has provided bonus fantasy points with his strike rate of 190 and 25 boundaries. Overall, he has scored 162 runs and taken two wickets in four games. However, note that his two fifties have come in the first innings when he did not have to carry the scoreboard pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ishan Kishan<\/span>\u2019s role is to go all guns blazing, and despite the risky approach, he has blasted 175 runs at an incredible average of 58.33. That said, he also struggled in the last two innings and would be keen on breaking the shackles going forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Rahul Chahar<\/span>\u2019s bowling figures read 1\/22, 2\/13, 3\/25, and 1\/41. Given the Pune wicket has been effective for the wrist-spinners, Chahar is likely to continue his momentum. To everyone\u2019s surprise, he boasted of his batting skills against Gujarat: 22* off 14 at No. 9.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart Picks for Mumbai vs Punjab Match <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Rohit Sharma<\/span> has only two scores above 25 runs in the ongoing edition, he revealed that he will look to bat as long as possible \u2013 an aspect most favourable for the fantasy players if not for Mumbai. Against Punjab, he has had a decent outing in the last two editions, registering top scores of 70 and 63.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Shikhar Dhawan<\/span> has been lucrative in fantasy cricket this edition. His scores read 43, 16, 33, and 35 \u2013 all this despite Punjab being on the backfoot in the powerplay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Kagiso Rabada<\/span> has not gone wicketless in three games. His best performance was 2 for 35 against Gujarat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tilak Verma<\/span> failed only once in four games and that too because he was run out. He was selected by over 50% of fantasy players in the last two games. He has scored 121 runs with a strike rate of 155.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Form Concerns<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Kieron Pollard<\/span> won the Player of the Match award against Punjab for his bowling figures of 1 for 8 in 2021. His recent form, however, has been nothing but ordinary. He has the highest score is 22*, and for a player who fields in the deep, he is yet to take a catch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After his 32 in the opening game, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Mayank Agarwal<\/span> has managed scores of 1, 4, and 5. His shot selection has been a major disappointment for Punjab and fantasy players.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Jasprit Bumrah<\/span> has gone wicketless in three of four matches. The three wickets he has managed came in one game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/player\/login#register?utm_source=m1c_blogpost_register&amp;utm_medium=organic\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"729\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner.jpg 729w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner-300x37.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner-696x86.jpg 696w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner-150x19.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mumbai vs Punjab Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Mumbai have lost four consecutive games, Punjab have won two of four matches.
