So, when elections were declared for the president of BCCI, there was drama. Afterall, there is no election without a strong fight from those standing for the position. However, unanimously Sourav Ganguly made the cut and is the next president of BCCI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The former cricket captain had a tough opponent, who had a fierce lobbyist. Brijesh Patel was lobbied by N Srinivasan from Tamil Nadu. Ganguly and Patel visited Amit Shah, Minister of Home Affairs to express their desire to be the President.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><p class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/player\/login.html\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/728x90-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"my11circle register\" data-id=\"496\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/ad-banner-space_728x90\/\" class=\"wp-image-496\"><\/a><\/figure><\/p><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The BCCI election was to be held at the Annual General Meeting on October 23<sup>rd<\/sup>. Interestingly, on Sunday, the BCCI gathered at a luxurious hotel in Mumbai to appoint Sourav Ganguly as the next President of BCCI. This was in defiance of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators&#8217; (COA) functioning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A source told Times of India newspaper, \u201cFinally, the decision was taken to bring Sourav on board. He will have just 10 months as president, but he has a lot of experience as an administrator, considering he\u2019s efficiently headed the Cricket Association of Bengal. Moreover, under the COA, cricket has suffered badly, so someone like Ganguly will be instrumental in putting things back together\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another source reiterates Ganguly\u2019s new position. The source informed Press Trust of India, \u201cYes, Brijesh was running for the President&#8217;s post with N Srinivasan actively lobbying for him. However, there was stiff resistance against him. We are happy Sourav is the new President&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><p class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/player\/login.html\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/728x90-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"my11circle register\" data-id=\"496\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/ad-banner-space_728x90\/\" class=\"wp-image-496\"><\/a><\/figure><\/p><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The outcome of the meeting is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>President<\/strong>: Sourav Ganguly \u2013 He is the president of Cricket Association of Bengal, (CAB).<\/li><li><strong>Chairman of IPL Governing Council:<\/strong> Brijesh Patel \u2013 He is from Karnataka<\/li><li><strong>Secretary<\/strong>: Jay Shah \u2013 He hails from Gujarat and is the son of Union minister Amit Shah.<\/li><li><strong>Joint Secretary<\/strong>: Devajit Saikia \u2013 From the Assam Cricket Association and he is in contention for the position.<\/li><li><strong>Treasurer<\/strong>: Arun Singh Thakur \u2013 Comes from Himachal Pradesh<\/li><li><strong>Male Representative of the Cricketers\u2019 Association:<\/strong> Anshuman Gaekwad \u2013 He is a former opener.<\/li><li><strong>Female Representative of the Cricketers\u2019 Association:<\/strong> Shantha Rangaswamy \u2013 She is a former captain of the Indian team.<\/li><li><strong>Representative of the BCCI at ICC:<\/strong> This position is still undecided.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>My11Circle could not be happier for Dada.
