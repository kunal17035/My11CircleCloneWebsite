The debutants have been impressive: two of their three defeats are last-over thrillers. Let\u2019s look at the top 5 fantasy picks for LSG.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.&nbsp;Jason Holder&nbsp;(134 points)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jason Holder missed the first two matches, and despite that, he is ahead of most of his team members in fantasy points. He has been consistently providing points with the ball, taking 9 wickets at an impressive average of 16. Bowling with new and old ball scales up his chances of taking wickets. In addition, he fields in the slips in the powerplay and in the deep at the death. He has three catches to his name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the bat, however, he is yet to make an impact. Batting at No. 4 or 8 hasn\u2019t worked for him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.&nbsp;Deepak Hooda&nbsp;(163.5 points)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deepak Hooda scored two fifties in the first three matches, but ever since, he hasn\u2019t been able to convert his starts. Overall, he has managed 193 runs with a strike rate of 129. His selection percentage read over 50% in six of eight games. He has also provided vital points with five catches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.&nbsp;Krunal Pandya&nbsp;(166.5 points)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lucknow Super Giants have exploited Krunal Pandya\u2019s multi-talents to their advantage, making him bat at any position. He has hit 112 runs with an incredible strike rate of 147. With the ball, he has bagged a three-for and two-for, also striking in the powerplay with his slow left-arm orthodox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Quinton de Kock&nbsp;(182 points)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that KL Rahul plays the role of a sheet anchor at the start, Quinton de Kock has to go bonkers right away and hence he has been blowing hot and cold. He has scored two fifties \u2013 one of which was a Man-of-the-Match winning performance. Overall, he has scored 228 runs at an average of 28. This is the first time in four seasons his average has dropped below 30.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.&nbsp;KL Rahul&nbsp;(279.5 points)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>KL Rahul has been dismissed on a golden duck in two matches, and on both occasions, he was a victim of a peach of delivery: one swinging away and inducing an outside edge and the other darting in late and dismantling his defence. That is all, though. In all other games, Rahul has been a part of the Ultimate Team on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-cricket-app.html\">My11Circle fantasy cricket app<\/a>. His 368 runs include two hundreds and a fifty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smart Pick<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s worth mentioning Avesh Khan\u2019s performance. He has taken the bulk of the wickets (11) for the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), including a two-for, three-for, and a four-for. More importantly, for a strike bowler who also bowls at the death, his economy of 8.2 RPO is impressive.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"6309\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After 8 games, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) rank fifth in the points table of the 2022 Indian T20 League.
