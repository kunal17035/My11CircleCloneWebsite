It\u2019s here. Fantasy Cricket League. Excitement. Tournaments. Players. What ifs. Maybes. You. And us!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to land a perfect fantasy cricket team or an easy way to predict which team would perform better, you\u2019ve come to the wrong place. But if you\u2019re someone wanting to be the most prepared player during the fantasy cricket league, read on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no such thing as a perfect player, perfect pitch, or a perfect team \u2013 but there are perfect ways to become better at creating a fantasy team on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-cricket-app.html\">fantasy cricket app<\/a>.  So yes, know the balance, let go of expectations around perfection \u2013 and bam! You\u2019re already halfway through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to keep in mind as you gear yourself up for the upcoming matches \u2013<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><u>DO\u2019S \u2013<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Practice patience:<\/em><\/strong> Before getting into the technical aspect of creating a team, don\u2019t forget to be patient and persistent. There would be times when no strategy would work in your favour, grit it out instead of quitting and feeling bad about it. Constant improvements and practice will reap benefits in the long run.<\/li><li><strong><em>Know the pitch:<\/em><\/strong> This is one of the biggest deciding factors of the game\u2019s outcome. So yes, do your homework before the match starts and consider everything that pitch experts have to say. You\u2019ll need a spinner, for instance, if the pitch is good for batsmen and vice-versa.<\/li><li><strong><em>Wait for the toss!: <\/em><\/strong>It\u2019s always a better idea to wait for the teams to see which player they would choose to go first. We\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want to make a team just because you are a fan \u2013 because fantasy cricket leagues are much bigger than that.<\/li><li><strong><em>Pick precisely: <\/em><\/strong>Choose wicket keepers and death-over players wisely. It doesn\u2019t really matter whether you take Player A\u2019s wicket or B, what matters is a bowler getting a wicket gets points (irrespective of the batsman). Therefore, make sure you pick up death specialists to get more wickets and more points.<\/li><li><strong><em>Read: <\/em><\/strong>For as much as it\u2019s about not investing in a single match, or thinking of fantasy games as the only earning source, you know what equally matters? Staying informed. From predictions to latest trends, if you\u2019re informed, you\u2019d definitely make better decisions.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><u>DON\u2019TS<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>But I\u2019m a fan: <\/strong>Right? Wrong! Players\u2019 stardom, reputation and heroic moments don\u2019t matter when you\u2019re making a team for a fantasy cricket league. What matters is their form, previous performance, and team combinations.<\/li><li><strong><em>Don\u2019t rush: <\/em><\/strong>Be it any league, don\u2019t try to invest too much at the very outset. Be mindful and allocate your budget accordingly. If you\u2019re someone who has just started, play practice games and real-cash tournaments in moderation.<\/li><li><strong>This is not the time to stand out: <\/strong>If you think<strong> <\/strong>you\u2019d pick out players<strong> <\/strong>not many have chosen and try to make a different team, you\u2019re on the way to lose already. Make sure you go with popular choices (after doing your own research, of course). Even if you want to choose a different player, do that once in 4-5 matches.<\/li><li><strong>Check the schedule: <\/strong>Keep it handy. To keep the balance of your team, you\u2019d want to check if a particular team is playing maximum matches within a specific period, if yes, try to add as many players from that team as you can.<\/li><li><strong>Don\u2019t put money on middle\/lower order batsmen:<\/strong> The chances of them contributing are bleak. Invest most in top-3 batsmen and you\u2019d see your team performing really well: believe us!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Also Read:<\/em><\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/typical-day-of-a-cricket-league-captain-5-lessons\/\">What the budding fantasy cricket players can learn from the usual day of cricket captains<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these are a few warm-up pointers for the upcoming daily fantasy cricket league matches: We\u2019re sure you\u2019re ready to put the fantasy cricket glass to play on!
