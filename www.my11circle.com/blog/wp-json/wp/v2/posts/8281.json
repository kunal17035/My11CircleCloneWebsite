Her form, however, in the Women\u2019s 100 League will wow fantasy players: 8 wickets and 82 runs at a strike rate of 151.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shafali Verma<\/strong>\u2019s job is to go all guns blazing, irrespective of the match situation. In her last five T20Is, she has hammered 123 runs at an average of 27 and a strike rate of 146. Against England, she has the highest score of 48.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 11 wickets in five games, <strong>Renuka Singh<\/strong> was the highest wicket-taker of the Commonwealth Games. She went wicketless only once and it coincidentally came against England. She strikes mostly with the new ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her last 10 professional T20s, <strong>Sophia Dunkley<\/strong> has scored 220 runs at an impressive average of 28. The highlight of her batting is that she rarely plays uncharacteristic shots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kate Cross<\/strong> has the ability to hit the corridor of uncertainty time and again, striking especially when the ball is new. In the 100 league, she managed five wickets and maintained an economy of 7. RPO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deepti Sharma<\/strong>\u2019s accuracy allows India to use her in the powerplay and at the death. With 12 wickets at 23, she is the highest wicket-taker for India against England. With the bat, she is known for occupying her crease for longer periods and averages 22.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 497 runs at a strike rate of 145, <strong>Smriti Mandhana<\/strong> is the highest run-scorer in the T20Is between these two teams. In the 100 League, she hammered 211 runs at a strike rate of 152. Both form and overall numbers are in favour of Mandhana.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Daniel Wyatt<\/strong> has scored the most runs (491) for England against India, also being the only Englishwoman to hit a hundred against the Indian Eves. In the 100 League, she collected a fifty-run bonus once and thirty-run bonus fantasy points twice in eight games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, <strong>Harmanpreet Kaur<\/strong> has scored 241 runs at an excellent average of 40, hitting two thirties and as many fifties in nine T20Is. Against England, she has accumulated 373 runs at 23. Although she does not bowl as much as she used to, she strikes at 23.5 in T20Is with her off-breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her last 10 professional T20s, <strong>Amy Jones<\/strong> has scored 234 runs at an average of 33. In the absence of star players, she will have to take the onus of holding the innings together. Not to forget the additional fantasy points she provides with her glove work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fantasy Tip of The Day<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India are superior in terms of both numbers and experience, while England play without their regular performers. A fantasy team featuring more Indians is likely to reap rewards.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"8281\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
