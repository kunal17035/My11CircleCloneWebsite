An average of 8 wickets fell in the same period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> August 10, 3.30 PM IST<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Probable Playing XIs for Scotland &amp; UAE <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Scotland<\/strong>: Kyle Coetzer, Matthew Cross (wk), Calum MacLeod, Richie Berrington (c), George Munsey, Michael Leask, Chris Greaves, Mark Watt, Alasdair Evans, Safyaan Sharif, Hamza Tahir<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Playing XI for UAE<\/strong>: Muhammad Waseem, Rohan Mustafa, Chundangapoyil Rizwan, Vriitya Aravind (wk), Chirag Suri, Basil Hameed, Kashif Daud, Akif Raja, Zawar Farid, Ahmed Raza (c), Karthik Meiyappan<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vriitya Aravind<\/strong> has been the man in form for the UAE this season. In his last ODI in June, he smashed an unbeaten 102 against the USA. Moreover, his last two scores against Scotland in the format read 54 and 31. Fantasy players can also expect points through his glove work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UAE will also rely on the experience of <strong>Chirag Suri<\/strong> at the top of the order. He has added 186 runs in his last 5 ODIs, including the highest score of 69. Against Scotland, he has smashed 2 half-centuries in 4 innings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Scotland lost the one-off ODI against New Zealand, <strong>Michael Leask<\/strong> made a huge difference in fantasy leagues by smashing 85 off 55 balls (9 fours and 4 sixes). Later in the game, he also finished with a two-wicket haul.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Scotland, <strong>Calum MacLeod<\/strong> will remain a key figure with the bat. While he was dismissed for only 7 against the Kiwis, his overall form has been impressive: he has slammed 3 half-centuries in his last 5 ODIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also Read:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/india-vs-pakistan-head-to-head-t20-stats\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">India vs Pakistan Head-to-Head T20I stats<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/ireland-vs-afghanistan-1st-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\">I<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">reland vs Afghanistan 1st T20I: Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/west-indies-vs-new-zealand-1st-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-team\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">West Indies vs New Zealand 1st T20I Fantasy Tips<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After his five-wicket haul against Namibia in July,<strong> Safyaan Sharif<\/strong> has gone wicketless in his last 4 ODIs. However, he has been making amends with the bat by scoring 84 runs in his last 3 innings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rohan Mustafa<\/strong> has accumulated 213 runs at 53 in his last 5 ODIs. Against Scotland, he has added 146 runs and taken 11 wickets in 9 ODIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matthew Cross<\/strong> will be high on confidence after his blazing half-century against New Zealand. He has also inflicted 5 dismissals with the gloves in his last 5 ODIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When UAE beat Scotland in the format a few months ago, <strong>Kashif Daud<\/strong> was the best bowler on show for his side. He finished with figures of 7-1-24-2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same match, <strong>Zawar Farid<\/strong> had impressive figures of 5-0-15-1 and later smashed a quickfire 32 off 19 balls. The UAE will hope for more such inspiring performances from their newcomers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Form Concern<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Richie Berrington<\/strong>\u2019s lean run with the bat will be a matter of concern for Scotland. His recent scores in the format read 12, 4*, 0, 3, 1, and 15. With the ball, he has taken only one wicket in this period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Scotland vs UAE, 1st ODI Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both teams have locked horns on 10 occasions in the format, out of which Scotland have won 6 and UAE 4. This year, though, both sides have split their wins in the ICC Cricket World Cup League. That said, the recent experience of playing against New Zealand at home might give Scotland a slight edge over the UAE.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7734\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
