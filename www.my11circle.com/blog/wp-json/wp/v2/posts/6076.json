For the past 14 years, the cash-rich tournament has thrown up multiple unknown names, who have excelled at the franchise level, and later gone on to represent the national team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2022 is no different either. Along with the debutants <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/cricket-teams\/lucknow-team\/\">Lucknow Super Giants<\/a>, Ayush Badoni too has made a resounding entry into the Indian T20 League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/nae.my11circle.com\/download?utm_source=m1c_blogpost_download&amp;utm_medium=organic\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"729\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-download-banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6084\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-download-banner.jpg 729w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-download-banner-300x37.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-download-banner-696x86.jpg 696w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-download-banner-150x19.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nerves of Steel<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just when LSG were reeling at 29 for 4 in their opening game against Gujarat, in walked the 22-year-old with a purpose. Although he had the daunting challenge of facing Rashid Khan and Lockie Ferguson, Badoni absorbed the initial pressure by remaining cautious. In fact, at one point, his strike rate dropped to below 100.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, he quickly turned things around by launching a calculated attack on the marquee Gujarat bowlers. From confident slog-sweeps and cheeky reverse to fierce pull shots, Badoni displayed a full range of strokes, much to the amazement of the fans at the Wankhede Stadium. In the end, the youngster finished his debut innings by scoring 54 off 41 balls (4 fours and 3 sixes).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Badoni also made his presence felt in LSG\u2019s second match against the four-time winners Chennai. Chasing a stiff target of 211, Lucknow needed 34 from 12 balls. Once again, the diminutive batter maintained his composure by nonchalantly depositing the very first delivery from Shivam Dube, deep into the square leg region. The winning shot in the final over too came off Badoni\u2019s willow as Lucknow Super Giants registered their maiden victory in the Indian T20 League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the game against Hyderabad and Delhi too, Badoni came to Lucknow\u2019s rescue by applying the finishing touches (19 off 12) and (10 off 3) respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Ayush Badoni&#8217;s Struggles and Misfortunes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Delhi lad has been making headlines in the ongoing edition of the Indian T20 League, his rise to stardom has been met with several hardships and misfortunes. Despite succeeding at the Under-19 level, the talented batter remained on the sidelines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Badoni was also approached by a few franchises for trials in the previous years, only to get ignored at the auction table. Despite impressing the Delhi coaching staff, he was unceremoniously shunned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, his fortunes turned around at this year\u2019s auction when the Lucknow Super Giants roped him in for INR 20 Lakh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Gautam Gambhir\u2019s Influence on Badoni&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Indian legend who is known for his conviction and generosity came to the aid of Badoni. Gambhir, who is now serving as the mentor of LSG comforted the Delhi boy by assuring him of adequate opportunities. Gambhir also encouraged Badoni to play his natural game by shedding unnecessary inhibitions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/player\/login#register?utm_source=m1c_blogpost_register&amp;utm_medium=organic\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"729\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner.jpg 729w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner-300x37.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner-696x86.jpg 696w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner-150x19.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Badoni\u2019s brilliance helping fantasy players<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Badoni was a surprise package in the opening match against Gujarat, his shot-making ability impressed one and all. He is also reasonably priced on the My11Circle platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Till now, the Delhi lad has generated 87.5 fantasy points on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-cricket-app.html\">My11Circle Fantasy App<\/a>.
