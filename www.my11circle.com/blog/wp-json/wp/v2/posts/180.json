Bangalore is your native town, but you were born and brought up in Mumbai. You have an emotional connect with both cities and cannot decide whom to cheer for.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll chant Rohit Sharma\u2019s name when he comes out to bat. You won\u2019t want Virat Kohli to get out. Dilemma, dilemma. Decisions, decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Rohit and Kohli are from India, so supporting them is innate. However, you like South Africa\u2019s AB de Villiers too. How can you hate a gentleman such as ABD? People shouting \u201cABD, ABD\u201d on the top of their voices echoes the entire Bengaluru during the IPL. Not only at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium but we witness it at all the stadiums in India. In fact, we support him even when he is playing against India. Then there is Chris Gayle, another entertainer. To put things into perspective, you cannot choose a team to support but finally decide to rely on favouritism.<\/p>\n<p>For example, here are the 11 players you decide to take side of:<\/p>\n<p>Rohit Sharma (c), Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers, Mandeep Singh, Parthiv Patel (wk), Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Mitchell McClenaghan, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah (vc)<\/p>\n<p>What if you win a cash prize for supporting these players? You may win hundreds, thousands, or lakhs, depending on these players\u2019 performances.<\/p>\n<p>Now, leave the emotional quotient aside. Use your analytical skills instead.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the match is at Wankhede Stadium, a paradise for batsmen. You think Suryakumar Yadav knows these conditions better than Mandeep Singh, or you analyse that Mayank Markande will be a better leg-spinner on this surface than Yuzvendra Chahal. You get to be a selector, dishing out a team of 11 players of your choice. You get to listen to your gut instinct, creating your own fortune.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t agree with the cricket experts\u2019 advice that Kohli will score more runs than Rohit at Wankhede. If so, you can assign Rohit as the captain of your team. You also introspect that Jasprit Bumrah will be the pick of the bowlers. If so, employ him as the vice-captain of your team. Remember, the captain gets twice the points and the vice-captain 1.5 times.<\/p>\n<p>You can also play it with your friends and family. If your friend makes Kohli the captain and Hardik the vice-captain and these two players fail to perform, you get to brag about your analysis, for your captain and vice-captain shone in the match. And to top it off, you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-cricket-app.html\">win a cash prize on our fantasy cricket app<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Still wondering why you should play fantasy sports?<\/p>\n<p>Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/journey-from-scratch-to-match-enter-my11circle\/\">How to get started with My11Circle<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"180\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <strong class=\"kksr-score\">4.1<\/strong>\n        <span class=\"kksr-muted\">\/<\/span>\n        <strong>5<\/strong>\n        <span class=\"kksr-muted\">(<\/span>\n        <strong class=\"kksr-count\">14<\/strong>\n        <span class=\"kksr-muted\">\n            votes        <\/span>\n        <span class=\"kksr-muted\">)<\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Suppose two of your favourite teams &#8211; Mumbai and\u00a0 Bangalore &#8211; are playing.
