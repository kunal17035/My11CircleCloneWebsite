This guide will tell you everything you need to know about this innovative fantasy cricket app before downloading it yourself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1) Set Up Proper Security Measures<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantasy cricket is a fun way to play with friends, but you should make sure your phone is secure before downloading apps. You should make sure you\u2019re protecting yourself from all possible threats before getting involved with any kind of online game like fantasy cricket. With My11Circle, you can be sure about the privacy and data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2) Use the Live Streaming Feature<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a die-hard sports fan, you know what fantasy sports is \u2014the game of building virtual teams using real-life athletes and competing with other players for cash prizes. Fantasy sports fans can also opt to watch games live on their smartphone, so they can change their line-ups in real time based on what\u2019s happening on the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3) Create Teams Across Multiple Leagues<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of cricket\u2019s biggest draws is its complexity. For diehard fans, fantasy cricket is a fun way to extend an interest beyond one particular league and create teams across multiple leagues. The process is easy, and there are plenty of resources available online that make it even easier for you\u2014and your tech-savvy friends\u2014to compete against each other for bragging rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Also Read:<\/em><\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/free-vs-paid-fantasy-cricket-games\/\">Free vs. Paid Fantasy Cricket Games<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4) Turn the notifications on<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re new to fantasy cricket or are just trying out a  fantasy cricket app, make sure you\u2019re updated on any changes made by your league administrator. My11Circle provides notifications and updates whenever there is a new tournament, but make sure you keep an eye yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5) Stay Updated on Rules Changes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a fantasy cricket player, it\u2019s important to stay updated on rule changes. The game can change quickly, and it\u2019s essential that you understand how changes will affect your team. Many players overlook rule changes but staying up to date allows you to react quickly during draft day or when setting your team line-up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6) Get Familiar with Player Ranks\/Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When downloading a fantasy cricket app, you\u2019ll be able to view live player rankings and scores. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with these terms, here\u2019s what they mean: The ranking indicates which player is playing well at that moment &#8211; helping you play better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7) Establish a Weekly Budget<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fantasy Cricket app does not charge for practice games. To help ensure you don\u2019t go overboard with your fantasy cricket budget, establish one at the beginning of each week, and write down how much you plan on spending. This will keep your purchases in check and help you stick to a spending limit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8) Subscribe to Team Alerts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantasy cricket has a lot of similar elements to real cricket and football matches. Still, you should familiarize yourself with some unique aspects of fantasy cricket before you download any apps or pick your team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9) Avoid distractions During Live Matches<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you\u2019re watching live matches, don\u2019t open your app. It\u2019s easy to get distracted when you can quickly see how other players are performing and check your line-up. If you give into temptation, it will affect your gameplay\u2014and end up costing valuable points. You might even realize that it was a mistake later on. So, for now, just leave your phone on silent during a match. Check out players during pregame hours instead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10) Pick Players with Consistent Performances<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s tempting to pick players on hot streaks, you\u2019re better off opting for consistent performers. While someone like Player A might score a ton of runs one week, chances are he won\u2019t replicate that performance again. Rather than taking risks with your fantasy cricket team\u2014especially early on\u2014stick with proven strategies that may not always have massive totals but won\u2019t leave you hanging either.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"4405\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My11Circle Fantasy Cricket App is one of the hottest apps on the market right now, but there are several things you should keep in mind before downloading it.
