From young to old, everyone wants to join this fantasy revolution and feel the excitement that it generates. Traditionally, the only way cricket fans would feel close to the game was by experiencing it in the stadium. More observant fans had limited ways to express their cricketing strategy and experience to the world. However, with fantasy cricket, things have changed now. Fans now not only get to use all their cricketing knowledge to good use, but they can compete against the best cricketing minds in the world. From International matches to domestic leagues, almost all official matches can be used by fans to showcase their skills.

Let us look at a few ways to win fantasy cricket mega contests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Do your research<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even for the more experienced fantasy cricket players, research counts for half the preparation they need to know. The need for proper cricketing research increases when we are playing \u2018mega contests\u2019 that bring a larger set of competitors. From playing conditions to research on individual players, proper knowledge is half the battle won. Cricket is a game of uncertainties. Therefore, to counter that, we need to be mindful of the data we have at our disposal. For people who may not have time to research for a long time, we do have extremely useful fantasy tips. These fantasy tips have been given by professionals who have done hours of research to pick the right combination for a match. Fantasy cricket websites have these tips to guide you in case you are confused about a certain selection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Wisely choose your captain and vice-captain<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is one thing to select a good team, but the more complicated challenge is to select a good captain and a vice-captain. Your captain and vice-captain multiply the points they get. Ideally, you need to select players for this post who are expected to do well in the game. However, as mentioned earlier, cricket is a game of uncertainties and almost anything can happen. Therefore, it is always recommended to look at the fantasy tips before selecting a player for captain or vice-captain. In mega contests, a wrong choice for captain and a vice-captain can badly affect your ranking even if you had a really good team.

All-rounders who bat in the top-5 and are consistent members of the team should not be missed while picking the team. You can always choose between the type of all-rounder depending on the playing condition. For example, in seaming or swinging conditions, you are more likely to score points with a fast-bowling all-rounder, but in spinning conditions, you will prefer a spinner all-rounder. Just make sure that the all-rounder you pick is quality and has enough consistency In recent matches. An out-of-form allrounder may not bat or bowl in a match, resulting in lower points for you.
