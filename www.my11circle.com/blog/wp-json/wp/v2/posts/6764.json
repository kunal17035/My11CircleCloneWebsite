Evaluate the playing conditions before finalizing your fantasy teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Teams<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Ireland:<\/strong> Mary Waldron (wk), Leah Paul, Gaby Lewis (c), Shauna Kavanagh, Arlene Kelly, Alana Dalzell, Jane Maguire, Cara Murray, Celeste Raack, Kate McEvoy, Sophie MacMahon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for South Africa:<\/strong> Laura Wolvaardt, Andrie Steyn, Sune Luus (c), Lara Goodall, Trisha Chetty (wk), Chloe Tyron, Delmi Tucker\/Anne Bosch, Shabnim Ismail, Ayabonga Khaka, Tumi Sekhukhune, Nonkululeko Mlaba<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Players to watch out for<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ayabonga Khaka<\/strong> has the experience and the class to trouble the Ireland batters. She comes into this series after playing the recently concluded My11Circle Women\u2019s T20 Challenge and Invitational tournament.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Laura Wolvaardt<\/strong> appears to be in red-hot form after scoring two unbeaten half-centuries in three games at the My11Circle Women\u2019s T20 Challenge. In her last five T20Is too, she scored two unbeaten 30s and one fifty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although <strong>Sune Luus<\/strong> hasn\u2019t contributed much with the bat in her last four outings against Ireland, she has bagged 11 wickets with her leg-spin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shabnim Ismail<\/strong> will remain a hot pick in fantasy leagues. In her last 10 white-ball games, she has taken 16 wickets, including best figures of 3 for 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lara Goodall <\/strong>and<strong> Chloe Tyron<\/strong> might not be big names but are capable batters who can be the surprise packages in fantasy leagues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ireland will pin hopes on their new skipper <strong>Gaby Lewis<\/strong>. Her last five T20I scores read 52*, 6, 105*, 8, and 32. She may only be 21, but she has already become Ireland women&#8217;s fifth-highest run-scorer across formats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Leah Paul<\/strong> has the ability to generate fantasy points with both bat and ball. In her last 6 ODIs, she has scored 249 runs and taken 6 wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mary Waldron <\/strong>and<strong> Shauna Kavanagh<\/strong> have decent experience behind them to score some important runs in this series. They could be the dark horses in fantasy leagues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both teams have locked horns on 10 occasions, out of which South Africa have won 9 and Ireland 1. Given the one-sided record, the hosts will have to punch well above expectations to stun the tourists. Moreover, the Irish haven\u2019t played a T20I since August last year and that may backfire too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 3 June, 9.00 PM IST<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"6764\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
