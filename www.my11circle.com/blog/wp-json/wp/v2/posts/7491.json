The team batting first has won 21 of 32 T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong>: July 30, 4:30 PM IST<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Probable Playing XIs for Zimbabwe &amp; Bangladesh <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Zimbabwe<\/strong>: Regis Chakabva (wk), Craig Ervine (c), Sean Williams, Wessly Madhevere, Sikandar Raza, Milton Shumba, Ryan Burl, Tony Munyonga, Luke Jongwe, Wellington Masakadza, Richard Ngarava<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Bangladesh<\/strong>: Litton Das, Anamul Haque, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Afif Hossain, Munim Shahriar, Nurul Hasan (c &amp; wk), Mosaddek Hossain, Mahedi Hasan, Shoriful Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Nasum Ahmed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players <strong>for the Match<\/strong> <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Litton Das<\/strong> averages 48 against Zimbabwe compared to his overall average of 20 in T20Is. His last three scores against them read 38, 59, and 60*. On the tour of West Indies, he scored a fifty and two thirties in six white-ball games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The onus of laying a strong foundation will be on <strong>Regis Chakabva<\/strong>. He has the highest score of 43 and 48 against Bangladesh in the format. In his last five T20Is, he has scored two thirties and two twenties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mustafizur Rahman<\/strong> has had a good year in T20s. He was the highest wicket-taker (19 in 11 games) in the Bangladesh T20 League and took eight wickets in as many games in the Indian T20 League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The All-Round Show<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sikandar Raza<\/strong> was the highest run-scorer (228 runs at 57) and the leading wicket-taker (5 wickets at 14) for Zimbabwe in the recently concluded T20 Qualifier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to his off-breaks, <strong>Mahedi Hasan<\/strong> can also pack a punch with the bat at No.8. He has the highest score of 92 in T20 cricket. We have also seen him getting promoted to No.3 on a few occasions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sean Williams<\/strong> has scored two fifties and a thirty in his last five T20Is, during which he also took three wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks for the Match<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Afif Hossain<\/strong>\u2019s one of two T20I fifties has come against Zimbabwe. On the tour of West Indies, his T20I scores read 0, 34, and 50. He has a reputation of thriving under pressure. He also has a happy knack of breaking partnerships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After a fantastic performance in 2021, <strong>Craig Ervine<\/strong> has been blowing hot and cold this year. He has one fifty and two thirties in 12 T20Is. For Zimbabwe to provide a steady start, their captain will need to up the ante.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the absence of prime fast bowlers Blessing Muzarabani and Tendai Chatara, <strong>Luke Jongwe<\/strong> will lead the pace department. He has taken 45 wickets at an impressive strike rate of 14 in 35 T20Is. Against Bangladesh, he has the best figures of 3 for 31.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mehidy Hasan<\/strong> last played a T20I in 2018. With Shakib Al Hasan opting out and Bangladesh playing without senior members, Mehidy will play a crucial role. His recent form is encouraging for fantasy players. He took seven wickets in three ODIs against the West Indies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also Read:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/west-indies-vs-india-1st-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\">West Indies vs India, 1st T20I: Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Zimbabwe come fresh from an emphatic victory in the T20 Qualifiers 2022 and will be confident going into the series.
