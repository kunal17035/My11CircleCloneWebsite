Now ask yourself \u2013 If you really want something, do you do something about it or wait for somebody else to hand it over to you? If this sounded confusing, here\u2019s a little something you could\u2019ve known by now about fantasy gaming \u2013 and it&#8217;s <strong><em>Game Theory.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving deeper into it, let\u2019s get the definition of this theory straight \u2013 <em>\u201cThe science of decision-making and strategy of competing and independent actors in a completely strategic setting.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>First things first:<\/em> There can\u2019t be any blueprint to fantasy gaming since none of the optimal strategies would work here, such is the nature of gaming industry. Here, players work with imperfect information, imply strategy to it, and seek pure value to reach the level of precision. Now, moving away from the herd, as contradictory as it may sound, is not necessary. In fact, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/\">daily fantasy cricket,<\/a> listen to what the herd says. If you see a player in 50 line-ups, chances are, he\/she is a quality value. Use the highest-owned players tactically, and you could maximize your projected points.\u00a0 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Here\u2019s an example\u2013<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose you\u2019re in a park and there\u2019s a competition to identify the colour of pets in a particular zone &#8211; they\u2019ll come out one by one and all you have to do is think about whether it\u2019d be black or brown. Now, which one should you pick? In order to maximize the correct answers, it\u2019s a prerequisite for you to know the common colour. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s black.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trusting your strategy and mathematics, let\u2019s give 60% weightage to black, 30% to brown, and keep a window open for 10% that could be a completely different colour. Since the game is about pure accuracy and there is no place for \u2018random\u2019 distribution, it\u2019d be wise to say \u2018black\u2019 each time for a long-term win. But then again, you might want to shift your strategy if 50% of them that already walked out are brown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is easy. If you are getting specific points for every right answer, wherein, the total is changing on the basis of colour of the pets \u2013 suppose 70 for brown, and only 30 for the black ones. The point total is going to increase every time you pick brown, which is around a 7:3 ratio in a 2:1 scenario.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is exactly how Game Theory can help when it comes to fantasy gaming. We strategically choose player A with B costs (called opportunity cost in Game Theory) and look for the quality players. This is how you need to find value in every game you play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the most crucial part about implementing game theory into<a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/\"> fantasy cricket<\/a>\u2013<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t necessarily maximize the points; it\u2019s implied to maximize the probability of winning the game \u2013 when used with right strategies and required skill. This theory is turning out to be such an important decision-making tool in fantasy gaming and otherwise that every player needs to know about it, or you\u2019d be left behind in the race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Here are a few Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do\u2019s \u2013<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You need to research and research a lot, but most importantly \u2013 Trust yourself. While it isn\u2019t necessary to put 24 hours into it, putting in zero would be a disaster too. Dig into the numbers, run history checks on players and choose the teams wisely when you&#8217;re playing a game on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-cricket-app.html\">fantasy cricket app<\/a>.<\/li><li>There\u2019s no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 when it comes to making the patterns. On the basis of games that you\u2019ve played, analyze the stats and be present in the moment. Read your favorite analysts\u2019 blogs and take part in discussions. Hear as many opinions as you can to choose what works best for you.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\u2019ts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Know the difference between choosing a low-gem and an underperformer. If a specific player performed well in the last 5 matches, and couldn\u2019t perform in the last one, you might want to research again.<\/li><li>The biggest Game Theory mistake you could commit is choosing players with low ownership. Make a chart with low-owned players and probability of them winning. Choose accordingly.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If there\u2019s one thing we want to tell you \u2013 Make a comprehensive process, put your head, skill and strategies to it \u2013 Trust the process.
