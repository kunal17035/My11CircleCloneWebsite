Between these two teams, she has scored the most runs in T20Is: 508 runs in 24 games. All numbers are in her favour!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From England, <strong>Alice Capsey<\/strong> has been the top fantasy player. She followed her 44 in the opening game with a maiden fifty in the format against South Africa. She has achieved all this in a four-T20I career. Moreover, she has wily off-breaks in her armoury. She went wicketless in only two overs she has bowled but seems like a promising all-rounder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about all-round skills, <strong>Sophie Devine<\/strong> has been excellent thus far. She has scores of 48 and 24 and the best figures of 3 for 37 to her name. Against England, she has managed 355 runs and 12 wickets in 19 T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her last five T20Is, <strong>Sophie Ecclestone<\/strong> has taken nine wickets and maintained an economy of just under 6 RPO. During all this, she also registered a score of 33* off 12 at No. 8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hayley Jensen<\/strong> has taken the bulk of the wickets for New Zealand. Her bowling figures read 1 for 22 and 3 for 5. Three of her four wickets have come with the new ball. She has progressed from a useful all-rounder to a new-ball spearhead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both games, <strong>Natalie Sciver<\/strong> could not capitalise on a good start. With the ball too, she is yet to make any impact. However, the need for her services will arise as the tournament intensifies. England are lucky that she has impressive numbers against New Zealand: 231 runs and 15 wickets in 14 T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katherine Brunt<\/strong> was promoted to No.7 in the last game and she responded with 38* off 23 including four fours and a six. She has batted as high as No.4, where she registered her top score of 42* off 18. Muscling the ball out of the park is her forte. With the ball, she has picked seven wickets in the last five games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amy Jones<\/strong>\u2019 death-over exploits (36* off 23) took England past the 150-run mark against South Africa. Given England\u2018s strong top order, she rarely gets enough deliveries to make an impact but she makes the most of what is offered to her. She also has two catches and a stumping to her name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Freya Kemp<\/strong>\u2019s entry into international cricket has been excellent. The left-arm pacer has taken five wickets in three T20Is, and more importantly, has a reputation for hitting quick runs in the domestic circuit. She smashed 40 off 23 in the English ODI Trophy just before the Commonwealth Games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pitch and conditions suit <strong>Amelia Kerr<\/strong>\u2019s brand of cricket. She has picked a wicket each in both games and has the highest score of 20. The extraordinary top order of New Zealand has not given her much opportunities to prosper of late.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>England Women vs New Zealand Women Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both teams are yet to taste defeat in the tournament. While England have struggled at times, New Zealand have been clinical and comprehensive in all the departments. In terms of head-to-head contests, England lead the way with 22 wins out of 28 T20Is.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7594\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
