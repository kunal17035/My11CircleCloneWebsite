The conditions have been friendlier for Bangladesh than the home team. The pitch has been on the slower side, making matters easier for spinners and harder for the batters to get going.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Probable West Indies &amp; Bangladesh Playing XIs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for West Indies<\/strong>: Kyle Mayers, Shai Hope (wk), Shamarh Brooks, Brandon King, Nicholas Pooran (c), Rovman Powell, Keemo Paul, Romario Shepherd, Akeal Hosein, Gudakesh Motie, Alzarri Joseph<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having already sealed the series, Bangladesh are likely to rest Mustafizur Rahman and play the in-form Taskin Ahmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Bangladesh<\/strong>: Tamim Iqbal (c), Litton Das, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Mahmudullah, Afif Hossain, Nurul Hasan (wk), Mosaddek Hossain, Mehidy Hasan, Nasum Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman\/Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Players for West Indies vs Bangladesh, 3rd ODI <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In his last five ODIs, <strong>Mehidy Hasan<\/strong> has racked up 13 wickets. Against West Indies, he has pocketed 26 wickets in only 15 games. In addition to this, he also produces fantasy points with the bat: his last five scores read 6, 81*, 6, 19*, and 30.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tamim Iqbal<\/strong> likes scoring heaps of runs in the Caribbean. He has scored two fifties and as many hundreds in his last five ODIs here. His last two performances \u2013 33 and 50* \u2013 were innings of high quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the series, <strong>Shai Hope<\/strong> had scored two hundreds in six ODIs. He, however, has not been able to continue the momentum, either falling to a brilliant delivery or being a victim of his stroke play. That being said, despite the ordinary performance in the last two games, he still averages 78 against Bangladesh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nasum Ahmed<\/strong>\u2019s maiden three-wicket haul in the format included the likes of Shai Hope, Shamarh Brooks, and Nicholas Pooran. He bowled stump to stump, also fooling the batters with his wily arm ball. He conceded a mere 19 runs in 10 overs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart Picks for West Indies vs Bangladesh, 3rd ODI <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mahmudullah<\/strong>\u2019s average has shot up to 68 against West Indies. His form with the bat has been superior in the 50-over format of late. Given spinners have dominated in the series, he is also likely to use his off-breaks. He has the best figures of 3 for 46 against West Indies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Batting at No.3 got the better out of <strong>Litton Das<\/strong>. By the time he took the crease, the ball had lost its shine. He remained unbeaten on 32 off 27 including four fours. His scores against West Indies during a chase are 41, 23, 94*, 14, 22, 1, and 32*.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The highest score for a West Indian in the series is 33 by <strong>Shamarh Brooks<\/strong>, and it came at a strike rate of 50. Of all the batters, he has been the best at negotiating spin. He has a fifty and a hundred in the last five ODIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nicholas Pooran<\/strong> played a reverse-sweep off the first ball he faced and dug his own grave. Although the conditions have not been conducive for the batters in the series, Pooran is experienced enough to correct his shot selection. Not long ago did he score 74* against the same bowling unit. The only glory he has to his name in the series is the wicket of Afif Hossain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The West Indian bowlers have not gotten enough runs to defend. <strong>Alzarri Joseph<\/strong> looked good in his first spell, but the pitch has more to offer to the spinners. The newcomer <strong>Gundakesh Motie<\/strong> took a wicket each in both games with his slow left-arm orthodox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keemo Paul<\/strong> smashed 25* off 24 comprising four fours. Had it not been for his brisk innings, West Indies would have been bundled out below 100. More importantly, he has a reputation for striking with the ball. His best figures against Bangladesh read 2 for 38.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also read:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/india-tour-of-west-indies-2022-schedule-venue-squad\/\">India Tour of West Indies 2022<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/how-to-win-fantasy-cricket-mega-contests\/\">How to win fantasy cricket mega contests<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Match Preview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bangladesh notched up their fifth consecutive bilateral series victory, while West Indies have lost three of their four ODI series this year. There\u2019s nothing much to play for West Indies, but a consolation win must cheer them up. However, for that to happen, they will have to play carefully against spin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong>: July 16, 7 PM IST<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7265\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
