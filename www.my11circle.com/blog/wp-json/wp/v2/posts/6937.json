Expect a delay, or worse, reduction in overs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Probable Playing XIs for India &amp; South Africa<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for India<\/strong>: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ishan Kishan, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (c &amp; wk), Hardik Pandya, Dinesh Karthik, Axar Patel, Harshal Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Avesh Khan<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for South Africa<\/strong>: Temba Bavuma (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller, Heinrich Klaasen, Dwaine Pretorius, Keshav Maharaj, Marco Jansen, Lungi Ngidi, Tabraiz Shamsi, Anrich Nortje<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also Read:<\/span><\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/advantages-of-playing-fantasy-cricket-on-my11circle\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Benefits of Playing Fantasy Cricket on My11circle<\/em><\/span><\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Players for India vs South Africa Match<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ishan Kishan<\/strong> has got starts in all four games, averaging 48. His 191 runs include 21 fours and 9 sixes. He was a power player of the Ultimate Team in two games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Harshal Patel<\/strong>\u2019s experience of playing at Bengaluru will come handy. This is where he has played the bulk of his games in the Indian T20 League. With 7 wickets 12.5, he is the highest wicket-taker of the series. South Africans are yet to figure out his change-in-pace deliveries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hardik Pandya<\/strong> has been batting with maturity of late, strategizing his approach according to the match situation. He has only one single-digit score this series; the other scores read 31*, 31*, and 46.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart Picks for India vs South Africa Match <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After playing T20Is for 16 years, <strong>Dinesh Karthik<\/strong> finally registered his maiden fifty in the format. He swept, pulled, reverse-pulled, slapped, scythed, and whatnot on Friday evening. He has been batting at a strike rate of 171 since the Indian T20 League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marco Jansen<\/strong> can pack a punch with the bat. South Africa sent him at No. 4 in the last game. The result was 12 runs including a six and a four. He also took the all-important wicket of the in-form Shreyas Iyer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shreyas Iyer<\/strong> could not put his best foot forward in the last two games, but his recent numbers in both international and domestic cricket keep him ahead in the race of fantasy cricket. At No. 3, he has three fifties and five scores between 25 and 49. He rarely throws away his wicket during the start of his innings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yuzvendra Chahal<\/strong>\u2019s best bowling figures of 6 for 25 have come at the very venue. In the ongoing series, he has bagged 6 wickets at 19.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dwaine Pretorius<\/strong> bats at No. 3 and completes his full quota of overs. His 5 wickets are the most by a South African in the series and has the highest score of 29.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Avesh Khan<\/strong> was excellent at reading the footwork of the South African batters. He mixed his lengths and pace smartly to force the batters into playing false strokes. His efforts rewarded him with a maiden four-wicket haul in international cricket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems South Africa\u2019s success majorly depends on <strong>Rassie van der Dussen<\/strong> and <strong>David Miller<\/strong>. If not able to launch an attack right away, the duo will at least have to occupy the crease until they get their eye in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Key Battles of the Match<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Keshav Maharaj<\/em> has dismissed <em>Rishabh Pant<\/em> twice in four games, and on both occasions, he bowled well outside off, made Pant reach for it, and induced a top edge. South Africa will employ Maharaj when Pant takes the crease; the Indian captain will have to manufacture different shots if he is to survive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Match Preview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/tournaments\/south-africa-tour-of-india-2022\/\">India vs South Africa series<\/a> is levelled at 2-2. With rain expected to dampen the mood, both teams will have to be ready for the DL method to make an unpleasant intrusion. Although the momentum seems to be with India, the visitors have already proved what they achieve even in these conditions. We are in for a crackerjack of a contest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"6937\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
