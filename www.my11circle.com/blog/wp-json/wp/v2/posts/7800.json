While he is yet to go ballistic in the tournament, his current form augurs well for his team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Daniel Sams<\/strong> too has contributed in a big way for his side by bagging 3 wickets in both games. Before coming into the tournament, he also took consecutive three-wicket hauls in the English T20 League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just when there were question marks about his form, <strong>Dawid Malan<\/strong> silenced his critics by blasting a match-winning 88 off 49 balls against Northern. He also generated bonus fantasy points by hitting 11 fours and 3 sixes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tabraiz Shamsi<\/strong> might have gone wicketless in the only game he played, but the nature of the format, coupled with his style of bowling, will always keep him in the hunt. Ever since he set foot on the English soil, he has taken 17 wickets in 9 games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Joe Root<\/strong>\u2019s services with the bat weren\u2019t required against Northern. However, against Birmingham, he accumulated 34 runs off 26 balls by playing smart cricket. This attribute, regardless of the format, helps immensely in fantasy cricket. He has also pouched 4 catches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Samit Patel<\/strong> has quietly contributed handy fantasy points by taking 3 wickets in 2 matches. While he is yet to wield his willow in this tournament, he certainly has the ability to make it count when the need arises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matthew Parkinson<\/strong> could be a dark horse in fantasy leagues. Besides picking a wicket in both games, he also ended up with 20 wickets in 14 English T20 League games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another valuable pick could be <strong>Paul Walter<\/strong>, who smashed a 10-ball 23 against Northern and then dismissed London\u2019s Ravi Bopara and Eoin Morgan in the previous game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Game Changers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After firing in the first match, both <strong>Jos Buttler<\/strong> (59 off 41) and <strong>Andre Russell<\/strong> (29 off 20 and 1 wicket), couldn\u2019t carry on the momentum into the second one. That said, these two are very much capable of pulling Manchester from the rut.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trent have had an impressive run thus far with two wins in as many matches. On the other hand, Manchester have lost both their games. However, not much separates the two sides when it comes to firepower and ability. Moreover, given the nature of the format, any team can come out all guns blazing.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7800\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
