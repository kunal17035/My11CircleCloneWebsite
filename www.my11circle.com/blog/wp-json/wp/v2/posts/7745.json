Neither the pacers nor the spinners have got enough juice to stamp their authority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong>: August 10, 12.45 pm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Probable Playing XIs for Zimbabwe &amp; Bangladesh <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Zimbabwe<\/strong>: Takudzwanashe Kaitano, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Innocent Kaia, Wesley Madhevere, Sikandar Raza, Regis Chakabva (c &amp; wk), Tony Munyonga, Luke Jongwe, Brad Evans, Victor Nyauchi, Tanaka Chivanga<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Bangladesh<\/strong>: Tamim Iqbal (c), Anamul Haque, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Mahmudullah, Afif Hossain, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Taijul Islam, Taskin Ahmed, Hasan Mahmud, Shoriful Islam<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players for the Match<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consecutive hundreds from <strong>Sikandar Raza<\/strong> has caught the cricketing world in a storm. Not that he is not capable of attaining the high but to achieve it in back-to-back, high-scoring, nervous chases is commendable. To fan the fire, he is also the highest wicket-taker (four) of the series. That\u2019s not all, though: he had also scored successive fifties in the T20I series. Phew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his last five ODIs, <strong>Tamim Iqbal<\/strong> has scored two fifties and three thirties. Although four of these innings have gone in vain, his consistency has made him a popular pick in fantasy cricket. Against Zimbabwe, he averages 43 compared to his overall average of 37 and has scored four hundreds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also Read:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/scotland-vs-uae-1st-odi-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-team\/\">Scotland vs UAE, 1st ODI: Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/west-indies-vs-new-zealand-1st-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-team\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">West Indies vs New Zealand Fantasy Team, Top Picks<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/asia-cup-2022-full-schedule-venue-teams-and-format\/\">Asia Cup 2022 Full Schedule<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/india-vs-pakistan-head-to-head-t20-stats\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">India vs Pakistan Head-to-Head in T20Is<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks for the Match <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Regis Chakabva<\/strong> registered the fastest hundred (off 73 balls) by a Zimbabwe player in ODIs. His recent numbers suggest that he prospers when he scores runs at a brisk rate. Putting a price on his wicket isn\u2019t his forte. In terms of fantasy this fact is often fraught with danger, but his glove work, punctuated by his breathtaking strike rate, keep him ahead in the race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mahmudullah<\/strong> has played 43 ODIs against Zimbabwe \u2013 the most against any nation \u2013 and has maintained an excellent average of 34. His 80* in the last match was his sixth fifty against them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his five-ODI career, <strong>Innocent Kaia<\/strong> has already scored a hundred, a fifty, and a thirty. Unlike Chakabva, he likes to hang around for longer periods. He strikes at 73 and holds the innings together \u2013 a trait advantageous in fantasy sports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Afif Hossain<\/strong> has two thirties and a forty in four innings on the tour. He can do both: accelerate the run rate and hold the innings together. Although he has not managed any wicket in Zimbabwe yet, his off-breaks can trigger breakthroughs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anamul Haque<\/strong> often feeds on the Zimbabwe bowlers. His top scores read 80, 95, and 73 (in the first ODI). Given the conditions have been easy for the batters, he will look to play it slow and safe and build a big innings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mehidy Hasan Miraz<\/strong> \u2013 if not the best \u2013 has been a strike bowler for Bangladesh. He has taken three wickets in two games, bowling in the middle overs as well as at the death. He did display a few attractive shots with the bat, but he did not have enough deliveries to make a bigger impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wesley Madhevere<\/strong> blows hot and cold, but his dual skills make amends more often than not. He scored only two runs but compensated with bowling figures of 2 for 40. In the T20Is, however, he displayed a better performance with the bat, registering the highest score of 67*.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh, 3rd ODI Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Zimbabwe won both games chasing a tough target. In one of them, they rose up from 49 for 4 to 291 for 5. On the other hand, Bangladesh have been doing everything right but until crucial junctures. With the series done and dusted 2-0 in favour of Zimbabwe, the tourists will look to end the tour on a high.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7745\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
