A day before, we had witnessed two scores above 140 runs. During all this, the conditions have been alike for pacers and spinners: some swing in the powerplay and some turn later on.

To add fuel to the fire, she is the top run-scorer in the T20Is between these teams: in 40 games, she has managed 969 runs at an average of 26.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tahlia McGrath<\/strong> has gone unbeaten in four of her six T20I innings. Her lowest score reads 14, while the remaining scores are 42*, 44*, 91*, 70, and 78*. In addition to the fifty she smashed against Pakistan, she took 3 for 13 \u2013 her consecutive three-for in the Games. Phew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sophie Devine<\/strong>\u2019s numbers against Australia are a joy for fantasy players. She has hit 454 runs at a strike rate of 109 and scalped 28 wickets in 29 T20Is. In the Games, she has collected 73 runs including the highest score of 48 and taken three wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In her last 10 white-ball matches, <strong>Beth Mooney<\/strong> has three fifties and two forties. Her top score of the Games is 70*, which came against Pakistan earlier this week. Against New Zealand, she has scored two fifties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amelia Kerr<\/strong> is the only New Zealand bowler who is yet to go wicketless in the Games. She has bagged four wickets and maintained an economy of just over six RPO. The batters have had to put a lot of effort to score runs off her leg-spinners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meg Lanning<\/strong> is the highest run-scorer for Australia against New Zealand: 615 runs including four fifties. She has a reputation for scoring big in knockout games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Zealand did not leave enough runs for <strong>Hayley Jensen<\/strong> to make an impact. She went wicketless against England, giving away only 11 runs in 2.4 overs. In the first two games, she had grabbed four wickets \u2013 of which three came inside the first six overs. Her overall economy reads 3.5 RPO, for which she has generated bonus fantasy points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ashleigh Gardner<\/strong> comes to Australia\u2019s rescue in times of trouble. She will play a crucial role in a high-intensity game such as the semis. Her highest score reads 52* and has the best bowling figures of 2 for 6 in the Games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her last seven T20Is, <strong>Alana King<\/strong> has a four-wicket and two three-wicket hauls. She has been Australia\u2019s best spinner in the format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alyssa Healy<\/strong>\u2019s form has hit a downward spiral since her terrific performance in the 2020 T20 World Cup, but such is the nature of her game. She thrives on taking risks. The result can be a string of low scores, but her role is to attack right away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/nae.my11circle.com\/download?utm_source=m1c_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-homepage\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"86\" src=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/t20-play-with-champion-download-now-4-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7693\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/t20-play-with-champion-download-now-4-3.jpg 696w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/t20-play-with-champion-download-now-4-3-300x37.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/t20-play-with-champion-download-now-4-3-150x19.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Australia Women vs New Zealand Women Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia are clear favourites for the Gold medal in the Games.
