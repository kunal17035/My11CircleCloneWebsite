In the recently concluded men\u2019s game between England and India, the tourists won by 49 runs. Out of 18 wickets to fall, only 2 went the way of a spinner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Teams<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Barbados:<\/strong> Hayley Matthews (c), Kyshona Knight, Deandra Dottin, Alisa Scantlebury, Tiffany Thorpe, Shai Carrington, Kycia Knight (wk), Shakera Selman, Aaliyah Alleyne, Shamilia Connell, Shanika Bruce\/Trishan Holder<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Pakistan:<\/strong> Muneeba Ali (wk), Iram Javed, Bismah Maroof (c), Aliya Riaz, Anam Amin, Omaima Sohail, Nida Dar, Tuba Hassan Ayesha Naseem\/ Kainat Imtiaz, Diana Baig, Fatima Sana<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nida Dar <\/strong>has got starts with the bat in all her last 5 T20Is. With the ball too, she has been impactful and taken 4 wickets. Pakistan will pin their hopes on this star all-rounder for similar contributions going forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hayley Mathews<\/strong> might not boast of great numbers against Pakistan in the format (71 runs and 4 wickets in 8 games), but her experience of playing on the big stage could come to her aid. In the past, we have seen how she has won games singlehandedly for the West Indies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike most Barbados players, <strong>Deandra Dottin<\/strong> has been playing List A cricket in England lately. In the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, she scored 70 runs and took 5 wickets in 4 games. Against Pakistan, she has the highest score of 90* in the format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Pakistan were restricted to 92 for 8 by Australia in Belfast, <strong>Bismah Maroof<\/strong> stood tall with an unbeaten 32. Against West Indies in the format, she has accumulated 306 runs at 30, including the highest score of 43*. Although she will be up against Barbados, most players are regular members of the West Indies squad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Muneeba Ali <\/strong>appeared confident in her innings of 19 and 29 in the recently concluded tri-series in Ireland. She will continue to open the batting and can also generate fantasy points through her glove work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shamilia Connell<\/strong> will lead the pace attack for Barbados. She has bagged 11 wickets, including the best figures of 3 for 21 against Pakistan in the format. When she last visited England in 2020, she claimed 7 wickets in 5 matches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since <strong>Tuba Hasan<\/strong> made her T20I debut a few months ago, she has been amongst the wickets (6), every time she has bowled. In the recently concluded Women\u2019s Emerging Teams Cup, she was also used as an opening batter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantasy players can expect decent contributions with both bat and gloves from <strong>Kycia Knight<\/strong>. Against Pakistan, she has added 215 runs at 30, including the highest score of 50*.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Omaima Sohail<\/strong> has been generating valuable fantasy points with both bat and ball lately. Besides having a happy knack for breaking partnerships, she can also play the role of a floater in the batting order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pakistan will have their work cut out against a formidable Barbados team, which comprises several quality West Indian players. Furthermore, Pakistan\u2019s recent form hasn\u2019t been very encouraging. Although they beat Ireland in the tri-series, they were on the verge of losing both games to Australia before the rain came to their rescue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 29 July, 11.30 PM IST<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7441\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
