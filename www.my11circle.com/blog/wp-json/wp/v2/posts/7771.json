While the pacers picked 9 wickets, the spinners could manage only 4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 11 August, 7.30 PM IST<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Probable Playing XIs for Oval &amp; Northern <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sam Billings will not be available for this game as he is busy playing for the England Lions against South Africa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Oval:<\/strong> Matt Milnes, Jason Roy, Will Jacks, Sam Curran, Jordan Cox (wk), Rilee Rossouw, Hilton Cartwright, Tom Curran, Mohammad Hasnain, Sunil Narine, Danny Briggs<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Northern:<\/strong> Adam Lyth, Faf du Plessis (c), Michael-Kyle Pepper, Adam Hose, John Simpson (wk), David Wiese, Roelof van der Merwe, Dwayne Bravo, Ben Raine, David Willey, Adil Rashid<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sunil Narine <\/strong>continues to impress with the ball. Not only has he given away only 46 runs off 40 balls in two games but has also bagged 5 wickets including the best figures of 3 for 21.<strong> <\/strong>With the bat, he has not got enough opportunities: he has added 15 runs and is yet to be dismissed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After scoring only 1 in the opening game, <strong>Will Jacks<\/strong> blasted 81 off 45 balls (7 fours and 4 sixes) to help his side register a 39-run victory over Welsh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With scores of 15 and 0, <strong>Faf du Plessis<\/strong> has disappointed fantasy players till now. However, he still averages a healthy 31 in competitive T20 cricket and should soon get back to his very best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adil Rashid<\/strong>\u2019s style of bowling is always going to keep him in the hunt. He has picked a wicket each in both the games and was the third-highest wicket-taker (12 in 7 games) of the tournament in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the match against Trent, <strong>David Wiese<\/strong> made a huge difference in fantasy leagues by smashing 50 off just 27 balls. He generated bonus points by hitting 5 sixes. Although he didn\u2019t pick any wicket with the ball, he gave away only 18 runs off 10 balls, including 4 dots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before getting out for a duck against Trent, <strong>Adam Lyth<\/strong> hammered 51 off 30 balls against Manchester. In the T20s, he has a staggering strike rate of 148.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/trent-vs-oval-english-mens-100-league-2022-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Trent vs Oval Top Fantasy Picks<\/span><\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/ireland-vs-afghanistan-2nd-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ireland vs Afghanistan Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/west-indies-vs-new-zealand-1st-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-team\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">West Indies vs New Zealand Fantasy Tips, Top Picks<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/india-vs-pakistan-head-to-head-t20-stats\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">India vs Pakistan Head-to-Head T20I stats<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The English All-rounders<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Curran<\/strong> brothers, <strong>Sam<\/strong> and <strong>Tom<\/strong>, have brought plenty of value to the fantasy players through their dual abilities. While Sam has added 34 with the bat and picked 2 wickets, Tom has scored 31 runs and bagged as many wickets.&nbsp; Besides being strike bowlers, they can be used as floaters in the batting order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their colleague <strong>David Willey<\/strong> too has chipped in with valuable contributions. In the game against Manchester, he took 2 for 24 in his full quota and later hammered a 21-ball 29 to guide his team to victory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Form Concern<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jason Roy <\/strong>seems to have carried his lean patch into the Hundred as well. His recent scores read 8, 20, 17, 0, and 10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Oval vs Northern Match Preview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both sides have played two games each and have had a similar run with one win and one defeat. Although Billings will not feature in the playing 11, Oval still appear a formidable unit. On the other hand, Northern have all-rounders galore in their scheme of things and they could end up being the game changers in this contest.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7771\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
