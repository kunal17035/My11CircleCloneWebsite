Surprisingly, after a string of low-scoring games, run-making appeared to be relatively easier in the last two matches. While 557 runs were registered, 24 wickets were claimed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 3 August, 3.30 PM IST<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Australia &amp; Pakistan Probable Playing XIs<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Australia:<\/strong> Alyssa Healy (wk), Beth Mooney, Meg Lanning (c), Tahlia McGrath, Rachael Haynes, Ashleigh Gardner, Grace Harris, Jess Jonassen, Alana King, Megan Schutt, Darcie Brown<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Pakistan:<\/strong> Iram Javed, Muneeba Ali (wk), Omaima Sohail, Bismah Maroof (c), Aliya Riaz, Ayesha Naseem, Kainat Imtiaz, Fatima Sana, Tuba Hassan, Diana Baig, Anam Amin<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless Pakistan dismiss <strong>Meg Lanning<\/strong> early, they could be in for some leather chasing. Her recent scores in the format read 36*, 8, 74*, 39, and 64*.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jess Jonassen <\/strong>and<strong> Alana King<\/strong> have picked 4 wickets each till now and will continue to be in the hunt on the sluggish wicket of Birmingham. Jonassen also finished with a four-wicket haul when these two teams last met in the Ireland tri-series. Meanwhile, King too walked away with 4 for 8 against Barbados a few days ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/ireland-vs-south-africa-1st-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\">Ireland vs South Africa 1st T20I: Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/pros-and-cons-of-creating-multiple-fantasy-cricket-teams\/\">Pros and Cons of Creating Multiple Fantasy Cricket Teams<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/netherlands-vs-new-zealand-1st-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\">Netherlands vs New Zealand, 1st T20I: Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/england-women-vs-new-zealand-women-commonwealth-cricket-games-2022-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\">England Women vs New Zealand Women, CWG 2022 Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Pakistan are to compete against Australia, skipper <strong>Bismah Maroof<\/strong> will have to shoulder the responsibility once again. When Australia limited Pakistan to 98 for 8 in the Ireland tri-series, she stood tall with an unbeaten 32*.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantasy players can expect some handy points from <strong>Omaima Sohail<\/strong>\u2019s dual ability. She has added 62 runs and picked 4 wickets in her last 5 white-ball games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Although <strong>Muneeba Ali<\/strong> has got starts (29, 19, 17, and 32) in all her last 4 T20Is, she has not been able to convert it into anything substantial. With the gloves, she has inflicted only 2 dismissals. Pakistan will need her to up the ante against the formidable Australians.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Australia were in a spot of bother at 49 for 5 against India, <strong>Ashleigh Gardner <\/strong>(52*) and<strong> Grace Harris<\/strong> (37) rose to the occasion and guided their team to safety. While their services weren\u2019t needed against Barbados, they could be the potential game changers in fantasy leagues going forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with Alana King\u2019s bowling performance, <strong>Tahlia McGrath<\/strong>\u2019s three-wicket haul too was instrumental in reducing Barbados to an embarrassing total of 64. Besides her bowling talent, she can also be useful with the bat down the order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since <strong>Tuba Hasan<\/strong> made her international debut a few months ago, she has shown enough promise to succeed as a spinner. The slow wicket at Birmingham will keep her involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Australia Women vs Pakistan Women, CWG 2022 Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pakistan have only beaten Australia twice out of 10 attempts in the format. Moreover, they have lost both their games and will be low on confidence. On the other hand, Australia are currently topping the Group A Points table with two wins in as many games. The mighty Aussies will be eager to achieve a hat-trick of wins.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7565\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
