In both matches, runs came thick and fast, despite the regular fall of wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Teams<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for England:<\/strong> Sophia Dunkley, Danielle Wyatt, Heather Knight (c), Danielle Wyatt, Amy Jones (wk), Natalie Sciver, Sarah Glenn, Kate Cross, Katherine Brunt, Issy Wong, Sophie Ecclestone&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for South Africa:<\/strong> Laura Wolvaardt, Lara Goodall, Sune Luus (c), Marizanne Kapp, Mignon du Preez, Chloe Tryon, Nadine de Klerk, Trisha Chetty (wk), Shabnim Ismail, Ayabonga Khaka, Nonkululeko Mlaba\/Tumi Sekhukhune<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sophie Ecclestone<\/strong> will remain the go-to bowler for England whenever they are in need of wickets. Currently, she is ranked the No.1 bowler in ICC T20Is and loves playing against South Africa. Remember her six-wicket haul in the 50-over World Cup?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the time <strong>Laura Wolvaardt<\/strong> landed in England, she has made scoring runs look easy. She has added 403 runs in 7 competitive games. As far as T20Is are concerned, she has the highest score of 55* and has been dismissed only on four occasions in the last 10 games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Africa have had a hard time stopping the juggernaut of <strong>Natalie Sciver<\/strong> on this tour. After blasting 169* in the one-off Test, she piled on the agony by scoring 55 and 63 in the ODIs as well. Interestingly, she also got a half-century when she last played against them in T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In only 2 T20Is this year, <strong>Danielle Wyatt<\/strong> has scores of 70 and 14*. At Chelmsford, she has slammed two half-centuries, including the highest score of 89* against India in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chloe Tryon<\/strong> enjoyed her time with the bat in the ODIs against England with scores of 88, 8, and 70. Although she didn\u2019t pick any wickets, she is known for generating fantasy points with the ball too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite having featured in 35 T20Is, <strong>Sophia Dunkley<\/strong> is yet to get past a score of 40. She, however, should be brimming with confidence after finishing the ODI series as the second-highest scorer (180 at 60).<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ayabonga Khaka<\/strong> is experiencing a drought in the wickets column lately. In her last 10 T20Is, she has taken only 6 wickets. Nonetheless, she will have to take confidence from the fact that she ended up with a three-wicket haul when the two teams last met in the format in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marizanne Kapp<\/strong> might have scored consecutive fifties in the ODIs, but she doesn\u2019t boast of great numbers against England in the T20Is. In 8 innings, she has managed only 102 runs at 12.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Form Concern&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sune Luus<\/strong> will be hoping for a quick turnaround in fortunes after her horrendous run in the ODIs. She was dismissed for a single-digit score in all the three games. However, she has all the experience to turn things around. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>England will be high on confidence after whitewashing South Africa in the ODIs. While the hosts played as a cohesive unit, the visitors failed to maintain consistency across departments. Furthermore, England also lead South Africa (15-3) in the head-to-head count and will once again be the favourites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 21 July, 11.30 PM IST<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7338\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
