More importantly, his last two innings were evidence of the fact that he can bat at a pace that his team needs him to. On Wednesday, along with KL Rahul, he lifted India from 43 for 3 to 134 for 4. In fact, this was his first ODI innings in which he batted at a strike rate lower than 94.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>KL Rahul<\/em>\u2019s numbers in the middle-order are fascinating. In his last 12 innings at either No. 4 or 5, he has scored two hundreds and four fifties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before visiting India, <em>Shamarh Brooks<\/em> was in top-notch form. He\u2019s equipped with an impressive technique, making him an excellent batter against both pace and spin. Against Ireland in January, he scored 93, 43, and 1, and his 44 of 64 in the second ODI kept West Indies in the hunt against the disciplined bowling attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the first-ball duck in the opening ODI, <em>Kieron Pollard<\/em> had scored a hundred and two fifties against India in 18 innings. He already plays enough T20 cricket and knows the nook and cranny of the Indian pitches and venues. Even if he holds one end, West Indies can battle neck and neck against the rampaging Indians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 6 ODIs, <em>Prasidh Krishna<\/em> has gone wicketless only once and has taken at least 2 wickets in the remaining games, fetching two Player of the Match awards in the process. His strike rate reads 21.6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Akeal Hosein<\/em> can pack a punch with the bat. A natural striker of the ball, Hosein\u2019s 34 of 52 kept India on their toes. With the ball, he has been getting enough help from the wicket but is inconsistent with his lengths.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Odean Smith<\/em>\u2019s two colossal sixes dropped Virat Kohli\u2019s jaws: one over deep mid-wicket and the other downtown. Before the blistering innings, he had dismissed Kohli and Rishabh Pant in the same over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only has <em>Alzarri Joseph<\/em> been effective with the ball but also been fetching crucial fantasy points in the field. He has taken 4 wickets, pouched 3 catches and induced a run-out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Shikhar Dhawan<\/em> scored 169 runs at 56, including two fifties on the South Africa tour. He, however, does have a great average (33 in 27 ODIs) against West Indies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Virat Kohli<\/em> got out off a short delivery in the first ODI and then induced an edge while driving one on the off-side. He looks solid until he lasts. That, nonetheless, isn\u2019t effective in the world of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/\">fantasy cricket<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/todays-match-prediction\/\">Match Prediction<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>West Indies\u2019 batting has lacked teeth. Only two batters have crossed 40 runs, and worse, they keep losing wickets at regular intervals. They need to build partnerships the way the home side has been despite throwing wickets in quick successions. They will have to perform out of their skin to end the series on a high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"4651\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time: February 11, 1:30 PM IST Venue: Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad Pitch Report The pitch appeared harder than it did in the first game, eventually helping the pacers.
