In the same game, <em>Azhar Ali<\/em> scored 51 and 31*. Before this innings, <em>Azhar<\/em> had scored 118 at Karachi. He seems to know the nook and cranny of the venue. His recent form and overall numbers make him a good candidate for captaincy in fantasy cricket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>90 off 158, a wicket, and a run-out: <em>Marnus Labuschagne<\/em> provided fantasy points in all aspects of the game. Against Pakistan, he averages 74 in 6 Tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nauman Ali<\/em> took 6 for 107 in the opening Test, dismissing the likes of Steven Smith and Usman Khawaja. At Karachi, he has taken 7 wickets (including a five-for) and played a crucial knock of 24 in one Test.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Imam-ul-Haq<\/em> was the captain of the Ultimate Team on My11Circle. He was also adjudged the Player of the Match for his twin hundreds. He batted well against the guile of Nathan Lyon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Usman Khawaja<\/em>\u2019s experience in playing the Pakistan T20 League came in handy. He fell 3 runs short of reaching his 11th hundred. Ever since his return to Test cricket, his scores read 137, 101*, 6, 11, and 97.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Abdullah Shafique<\/em> has played 3 Tests and has already scored 330 runs at 82.5, including a hundred and two fifties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Steven Smith<\/em> averages a mere 35.7 this season. His 78 off 196, however, was a knock of substance. Given he is a brilliant player of spin, he will play a key role on this pitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Babar Azam<\/em> and <em>Mohammad Rizwan<\/em> did not have much role to play in the first Test, but the duo will continue to be Pakistan\u2019s cynosure in the middle-order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>David Warner<\/em> continued hunting down the Pakistani bowlers. His 68 was his eighth 50-plus score in eight Tests against them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all depends on how the pitch behaves. Although it was an easy wicket to bat on at Rawalpindi, Australia fared well against the Pakistani spinners and played according to the merit of the ball. This time, however, there will be more zip and turn. It will be a test of character and patience for the visitors. On the other hand, Pakistan have a reputation for getting carried away. Australia won\u2019t let them off the hook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready for the game? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-cricket-app.html\">Download fantasy cricket app<\/a> and pick your team now!<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"5523\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time: March 12, 10:30 AM IST Venue: National Stadium, Karachi Pitch Report The Rawalpindi pitch was lifeless, and not only the fans but also the players are hoping for a result in Karachi.
