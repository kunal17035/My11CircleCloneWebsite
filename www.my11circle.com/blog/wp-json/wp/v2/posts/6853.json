Expect another run-fest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong>: June 10, 4:30 PM IST<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Also Read: <\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/5-reasons-why-fantasy-cricket-is-more-popular-than-other-fantasy-sports-in-india\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Why Fantasy Cricket Is More Popular than Other Fantasy Sports in India<\/em><\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Probable Playing XI for Pakistan &amp; West Indies: <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Pakistan<\/strong>: Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Mohammad Haris, Khushdil Shah, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Hasan Ali, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for West Indies<\/strong>: Shai Hope, Shamarh Brooks, Nicholas Pooran (c &amp; wk), Brandon King, Kyle Mayers, Rovman Powell, Akeal Hosein, Romario Shepherd, Alzarri Joseph, Jayden Seales, Hayden Walsh<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Players for Pakistan vs West Indies Match<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shai Hope<\/strong> has scored two hundreds in 8 days, in two different conditions, that is, one in the Netherlands and the other in Pakistan. His key to success is to start the innings slowly and then up the ante once he finds his feet. Against Pakistan in ODIs, he averages 50 in 5 games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Babar Azam<\/strong>\u2019s last 5 ODI scores read 158, 57, 114, 105*, and 103. Above all, 5 of his 17 hundreds have come against West Indies in 8 innings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the same note, <strong>Imam-ul-Haq<\/strong> has not been any less. He has scored two hundreds and two fifties in the last four ODIs. Talk about numbers!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is not all, though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shamarh Brooks<\/strong>, in only his 10-ODI career, has scored three fifties and a hundred, and averages 48. Given the pitch and conditions, the fantasy players will have a tough time narrowing down their choices for captaincy and vice-captaincy. Making multiple teams seems to be a good decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart Picks\u00a0for Pakistan vs West Indies Match <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before his 59 in the opening ODI, <strong>Mohammad Rizwan<\/strong> had smashed 152 runs in 3 games in the English T20 Cricket. He has been in tremendous form of late.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three of <strong>Haris Rauf<\/strong>\u2019s four wickets came at the death. He mixed up his in-coming length deliveries with slower balls, gradually tricking the batters into playing false strokes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shaheen Afridi<\/strong> continued doing what he does best. He took one wicket in the powerplay and one at the death. In his last three ODI games in Pakistan, he has hunted down 8 wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alzarri Joseph<\/strong> seemed the only West Indian bowler to threaten the Pakistani batters, maintaining tight lines and lengths. He took the all-important wicket of Babar, followed by inducing an edge off Shadab Khan\u2019s bat. He has been West Indies\u2019 best bowler for a while now: in 46 ODIs, he has managed as many as 75 wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was <strong>Khushdil Shah<\/strong>\u2019s rampaging knock of 41* off 33 that hammered the final nail in the coffin. His strike rate reads 109 in 5 ODIs. He is employed to go bonkers right from the word go. He has been the leading six-hitter in Pakistan&#8217;s domestic cricket for a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rovman Powell<\/strong> has been having a good time with the bat since the Indian T20 League. However, he has not been able to convert the starts into anything substantial. In his last 10 competitive matches, he has managed six scores above 30 runs but only one of them was converted into a fifty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Pakistan vs West Indies Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bowlers from both teams struggled to keep the runs in check. Pakistan, however, had the advantage of batting second. They strategised the run chase effectively, and the implementation was even better. The West Indian bowlers will have to pull up their socks and put up a better show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"6853\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
