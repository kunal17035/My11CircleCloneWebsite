This has been the trend for a long time. Cricket is a summer sport, but that is being questioned as the effects of climate change is affecting various aspects of cricket.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the cricket-friendly nations are in the Asian sub-continent and few Middle Eastern nations. However, the summer in the past few years is stressing the players and the cricket field too. The sun is harsher and there is a lack of water for different factors associated with cricket. Also, players wear clothing that is not conducive for the body that is active out in the bright sun. Add to it, they have the heavy gear too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the International Cricket Council has not taken heed to the effects; there are voices from the Australian players about the impact of climate change on cricket. Former Australia captain, Ian Chappell wrote on ESPNcricinfo, \u201cThe effects of climate change on the game are a major concern, and the solutions rely on decisive action being taken by some annoyingly reticent politicians\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><p class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/player\/login.html\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/728x90-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"my11circle register\" data-id=\"496\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/ad-banner-space_728x90\/\" class=\"wp-image-496\"><\/a><\/figure><\/p><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>He further states, \u201cFor starters, drastic increases in temperature will add to the health dangers for players. There\u2019s nothing more frustrating than a game delayed by rain but imagine if players are off the field because the sun burns too brightly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His concerns align with the future steps the boards should take for its players. \u201cThat is the reality if temperatures keep rising; players will need to be protected from heatstroke or more lasting skin-cancer damage. In a litigious era, cricket boards will need to proceed with caution.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australian cricket legend Shane Warne, who is on the MCC World Committee, has also voiced his concern. \u201cAt times in the past, it has been hard to know who to believe, but I think we all have to admit now that climate change is a huge issue,\u201d the former leg-spinner said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBefore I\u2019d seen the report, I hadn\u2019t really thought about how it would impact the game of cricket. How the risks affect local club cricket, how clubs have had their changing rooms destroyed by flooding in the UK, how the rising temperatures affect the way grass grows, was scary.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><p class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/player\/login.html\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/728x90-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"my11circle register\" data-id=\"496\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/ad-banner-space_728x90\/\" class=\"wp-image-496\"><\/a><\/figure><\/p><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the name of cricket and the future of sports, we need to rethink ways to control and reverse the effects of climate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>NOTE:<\/strong>\u00a0Try\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/\">fantasy cricket<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0and get to know your cricket skills. <br><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"2158\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Come summer, come the cricket season.
