He has not been the destructive Guptill we know. He played a responsible innings of 45 off 36 amidst a slow run rate and consistent fall of wickets. His last three white-ball scores read 40, 47, and 45.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bas de Leede<\/strong>\u2019s top scores in the last five T20Is read 36*, 91*, and 66. During this, he also picked up seven wickets. To make matters more interesting, he has only two scores in single digits in the last 10 white-ball games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blair Tickner<\/strong> took three wickets in the powerplay and one at the death. The four-wicket haul was a result of the attacking lines he bowled. The pitch and conditions might work in his favour, but he also has the tendency to spray the ball around at regular intervals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bear Sears<\/strong> thrived on bowling short lengths and was successful in inducing edges. He read the batters\u2019 footwork and accordingly adjusted his lengths. The outcome was 3 for 22, his best bowling figures in T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Neesham<\/strong> came to New Zealand\u2019s rescue after their innings went off the rails towards the end of the middle overs. He came and tonked 32 off 17, and pulled the game in New Zealand\u2019s favour. It was his fourth consecutive 20-plus score in T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shariz Ahmed<\/strong> has not gone wicketless in his last five T20Is, taking a total of six wickets. New Zealand tried but could not dominate his leg-spin. In the process, he finished with 2 for 15&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Logan van Beek<\/strong>\u2019s form has been phenomenal since the ICC T20 Qualifiers. In the last five T20Is, he has taken a two-wicket, three-wicket, and four-wicket haul. In the first T20I, both his wickets came at the death.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Max O\u2019Dowd<\/strong> played an uncharacteristic stroke after a top-notch performance in the Qualifiers, during which he had a thirty, forty, and a fifty to his credit. He shuffled across and tried to scoop Tickner over fine-leg only to get his defence dismantled. Given his experience and recent form, he will be mindful of his strokeplay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tom Cooper<\/strong> has a knack for blowing hot and cold. The 81* against Uganda last month is evidence to the very fact. He will have to rethink his live-by-the-sword approach and use his talents efficiently. He hasn\u2019t been bowling much either lately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even a batter of <strong>Finn Allen<\/strong>\u2019s might could not use the long handle with ease. He will have to change his approach at the Sportpark Westvliet: perhaps, see off the new ball and accelerate as the game progresses. The fact that he has been consistently scoring runs should help him redesign his strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his last five T20Is, <strong>Ish Sodhi<\/strong> has grabbed 11 wickets including a four-wicket and three-wicket haul each. He has achieved all this while maintaining an economy of just over six RPO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Netherlands vs New Zealand, 2nd T20I Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Netherlands put up a spirited effort to reach 132 in a tricky chase of 148. A collective batting performance perhaps would have rescued them, but they gave their all to come close. New Zealand, however, would be on their toes. The late impetus by Neesham saved the day for them. However, the Kiwis have clean swept Ireland and Scotland in the last few weeks and will be keen on leaving Europe on a high.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7645\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
