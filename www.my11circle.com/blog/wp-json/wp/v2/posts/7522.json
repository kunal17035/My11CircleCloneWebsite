The middle overs especially have been a challenge for keeping the scoreboard ticking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong>: August 2, 3:30 PM IST<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Probable New Zealand &amp; Sri Lanka Teams<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for New Zealand<\/strong>: Sophie Devine (c), Suzie Bates, Amelia Kerr, Maddy Green, Brooke Halliday, Hayley Jensen, Izzy Gaze (wk), Lea Tahuhu, Hannah Rowe, Fran Jonas, Eden Carson<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Sri Lanka<\/strong>: Chamari Athapaththu (c), Vishmi Gunaratne, Hasini Perera, Kavisha Dilhari, Nilakshi de Silva, Anushka Sanjeewani (wk), Ama Kanchana, Oshadi Ranasinghe, Sugandika Kumari, Inoka Ranaweera, Achini Kulasuriya<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players for New Zealand Women vs Sri Lanka Women&#8217;s Match<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Suzie Bates<\/strong> was the star performer against South Africa, blasting 91 off 64 including eight fours and three sixes. She also provided bonus fantasy points for two catches. In addition to her recent form, she has impressive numbers against Sri Lanka: 266 runs at an average of 38.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chamari Athapaththu<\/strong> has scored three forties in eight T20Is against New Zealand. Her recent stats too are enticing for fantasy players. She has one thirty, one forty, and one fifty in her last five games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sophie Devine<\/strong> put up a terrific all-round performance against South Africa last week. She scored 48 off 40 and complimented it with a three-wicket haul. Before this, her last three T20 scores in professional cricket read 52, 37, and 51. Against Sri Lanka, she has the highest score of 75* and has scalped six wickets in eight T20Is. Talk about numbers!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Spin to Win<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Inoka Ranaweera<\/strong>\u2019s left-arm orthodox trapped England in a spin. The opposition batters could not consistently counterattack the deceiving tossed-up deliveries of Inoka. She was smart enough to read the batters\u2019 footwork. In her last 10 white-ball games, she has managed 16 wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amelia Kerr<\/strong>\u2019s accuracy with leg-breaks was commendable. She finished with figures of 1 for 24. Moreover, her ability to hit boundaries at will helps New Zealand employ her at any batting position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Oshadi Ranasinghe<\/strong> not only generated fantasy points for picking two wickets but also produced additional points for her economy of 5 RPO. Her wily off-breaks were too good to put away for boundaries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also Read:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/west-indies-vs-india-2nd-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-team\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">West Indies vs India 2nd T20I Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong> <strong> <strong>for New Zealand Women vs Sri Lanka Women&#8217;s Match<\/strong> <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nilakshi de Silva<\/strong> has been so consistent in the middle overs for Sri Lanka that her lowest score reads 25 in her last five white-ball games. Her strike rate may not be encouraging, but the average number of runs she has been collecting is enough for fantasy players to pick her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hayley Jensen<\/strong> struck in her very first over, eventually finishing with the figures of 1 for 22. Her job is to contain runs with her medium pace, be it in the powerplay or at the death.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kavisha Dilhari<\/strong>\u2019s all-round ability keeps the fantasy players interested. She recently registered her highest score (47*) against India. Her off-breaks, though, do not fetch her wickets quite often, but the pitch has enough for her to make breakthroughs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Zealand have won all eight T20Is against Sri Lanka. They started the tournament with a 13-run win over South Africa and boast of a formidable team. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have lost five of the last six T20Is and suffered a five-wicket defeat over England. All in all, numbers and form both are in the favour of New Zealand.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7522\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
