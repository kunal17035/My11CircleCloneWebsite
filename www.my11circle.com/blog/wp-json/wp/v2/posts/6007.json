The average first and second innings scores at this venue are 180 and 156 respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Probable Playing XIs for Bangalore &amp; Mumbai<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Glenn Maxwell will be available for selection. Sherfane Rutherford is likely to make way for the Australian star.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/cricket-teams\/bangalore-team\/\">Bangalore<\/a>:<\/strong> Faf du Plessis* (c), Anuj Rawat, Virat Kohli, Glenn Maxwell*, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Wanindu Hasaranga*, David Willey*, Harshal Patel, Akash Deep\/Siddharth Kaul, Mohammed Siraj<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel Sams is likely to be dropped after costing Mumbai the game against Kolkata.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/cricket-teams\/mumbai-team\/\">Mumbai<\/a>:<\/strong> Ishan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma (c), Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Kieron Pollard*, Riley Meredith*, Dewald Brevis*, Murugan Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Tymal Mills*, Basil Thampi\/Jaydev Unadkat<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Players for Bangalore vs Mumbai Match  <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In his very first game, Suryakumar Yadav made an impact with the bat by scoring 52 off 36 balls, including 5 fours and 2 sixes. He is arguably the best player of spin bowling in the tournament. He has made the No.3 position his own in the Mumbai lineup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tilak Varma has been a surprise package in this edition. The youngster\u2019s maturity and shot-making ability is already making headlines. His scores read 22, 61, and 38*. In addition to his gutsy batting, he has also taken some clean catches in the deep. They all add to the fantasy points tally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Ishan Kishan couldn\u2019t find the desired momentum against Kolkata, he remains the leading run-scorer (149) for his side this season. Mumbai will continue to pin hopes on their diminutive wicketkeeper-batter to explode in the powerplay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glenn Maxwell was the best batter on show (513 runs) for Bangalore in the previous edition. Furthermore, he will also have fond memories of scoring a half-century when he last played against Mumbai in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also Read: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/chennai-vs-hyderabad-indian-t20-league-2022-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\">Fantasy Cricket Tips for Chennai vs Hyderabad Match <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart Picks for Bangalore vs Mumbai Match   <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are very few better finishers in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/tournaments\/indian-t20-league\/\">Indian T20 League<\/a> than Dinesh Karthik. His cameo 44 off 23 balls at a strike rate of 191.3 against Rajasthan swung the game in Bangalore\u2019s favour. Interestingly, he is yet to be dismissed in the competition. Given his recent run, he is one of the hottest picks in fantasy leagues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mumbai might have lost three games in a row, but Tymal Mills has done a good job with the ball by picking 6 wickets. His short balls have fetched him the desired results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bangalore would want Wanindu Hasaranga to exert pressure on Mumbai\u2019s middle- and lower-order. The legspinner has bagged 6 wickets, including a match-winning four-wicket haul against Kolkata.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Bangalore are to continue their winning run, they will need significant contributions at the top from Virat Kohli<em> <\/em>and<em> <\/em>Faf du Plessis. Between the two, they have added only 180 runs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harshal Patel keeps consistently delivering for Bangalore. He has taken 4 wickets in this edition and was also the Player of the Match when he bowled against Mumbai in the opening game of 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Rohit Sharma is yet to set the stage on fire this season. Against Bangalore, he has scored 759 runs at 27, including the highest score of 94. The Mumbai skipper has also registered 7 half-centuries against the same opposition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2> Bangalore vs Mumbai Match Preview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/mumbai-vs-bangalore\/\">Mumbai have dominated Bangalore in the head-to-head count (19-12)<\/a>, they have lost their last two encounters to them. Moreover, the five-time champions will also be under immense pressure coming into this clash, after suffering a hat-trick of defeats in this edition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Bangalore have managed to win two games in a row, post their defeat to Punjab earlier in the competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bangalore\u2019s lineup will also be strengthened with the presence of Maxwell. For Mumbai, though, getting their bowling act together will take top precedence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 9 April, 7.30 PM IST&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"6007\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
