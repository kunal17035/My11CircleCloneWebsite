We won\u2019t get to listen to banters behind the wickets in the three-ODI series between India and Australia, but do not worry: we have got MS Dhoni to tickle our funny bones.<\/p>\n<p>Dhoni doesn\u2019t prefer sledging, but when it comes to trolling his own team members, he leaves no stone unturned. Once reminding Ravindra Jadeja \u2013 who Dhoni prefers calling Sir Jadeja \u2013 to bowl the right line, he quipped, \u201cJaddu, thoda off mein daal. Pujara ko waha taali bajaane ke liye nahi rakha hai.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is one of the many <em>Dhoni gems\u00a0<\/em>the stump mic has captured, but the contest between India and Australia is far more than wordplay and humour. It is about playing fire with fire, rattling stumps with pace, deceiving batters with spin, hitting the ball so long and high that you think it may never fall off the orbit, and whatnot.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Headlines<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jasprit Bumrah has been rested, until Australia tour India next month. Mohammad Siraj is his replacement.<\/p>\n<p>BCCI have suspended KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya over their comments in a talk show, until further notice.<\/p>\n<p>Australia have called up Ashton Turner as a coverup for Mitchell Marsh who was hospitalised to diagnose gastritis.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s list down the players who are likely to accumulate more points in our fantasy team.<strong>Note:<\/strong>\u00a0Make your\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/\"><strong>fantasy cricket<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0team by knowing the statistics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MY XI: <\/strong>Rohit Sharma (c), Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Aaron Finch (vc), Glenn Maxwell, MS Dhoni\/Alex Carey (wk), Marcus Stoinis, Kuldeep Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Khaleel Ahmed, Adam Zampa<\/p>\n<p><strong>Batters<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Who has scored the most ODI runs against Australia in Australia? Sachin Tendulkar? No. Virat Kohli? Uh, no. The answer is Rohit Sharma. He has scored 805 runs at 57.5 in 16 games, with a highest score of 171*. In his last ODI at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), he was dismissed on 99. He\u2019d like to avenge that on Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>If there\u2019s an opposition Kohli likes to grind to the dust, it is Australia. Not that there\u2019s any bad blood, but Kohli likes to smash those who intimidate him. He has 5 hundreds and as many fifties against them.<\/p>\n<p>If India are playing limited-overs, you have to take the trio of Rohit, Kohli, and Dhawan. If not all three, two of them score bulk of the runs. And when all three go bonkers, the oppositions hope for the match to conclude soon and the fantasy players count their blessings. While Kohli ranks first in the ICC ODI Rankings, Rohit and Dhawan are placed at second and ninth positions respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Just like Rohit takes on the Australian bowlers, Finch fancies breaking the Indian bowlers to pieces. In 17 ODIs he has bludgeoned 830 runs, including 2 hundreds and 6 fifties.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wicketkeeper<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Alex Carey could score a mere 31 runs in the T20I series, but he made amends in the ongoing Big Bash League: he collected 162 runs in 6 matches, with a highest score of 70. Although Dhoni has played 326 matches and scored 9,974 runs more than Carey, his form is questionable. He last played professional cricket on November 1. The choice is yours: form vs experience.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to keep winning?

Maxwell didn\u2019t get to bowl in that match, but Stoinis ended with figures of 2 for 27 and took his team to a narrow victory by 4 runs.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s concerning for India is that Maxwell and Stoinis were in incredible form in the BBL. While Maxwell blasted 129 runs, Stoinis walloped 146 runs in 5 matches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bowlers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bhuvi hasn\u2019t played a professional match for 47 days now. The last he played was in the third T20I at the same venue. However, this won\u2019t bother the experienced lad. If anything, he will be eager to bowl. To make matters more interesting, he is only a victim away from completing 100 ODI wickets.<\/p>\n<p>Kuldeep is the second-fastest Indian to 50 ODI wickets, and is slowly becoming the cynosure of Indian bowling. The alternative is his spin partner Yuzvendra Chahal, but if the conditions are more friendly for the pacers, India will only draft in Kuldeep.<\/p>\n<p>Joining the wrist-spin bandwagon is Zampa, the man responsible for India\u2019s defeat in the first T20I. He took wickets of Kohli and KL Rahul and later on bowled Rohit in the final T20I.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Australia<\/strong>: Aaron Finch (c), Usman Khawaja, Shaun Marsh, Peter Handscomb, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey (wk), Adam Zampa, Jason Behrendorff, Peter Siddle, Billy Stanlake<\/p>\n<p><strong>Probable XI for India<\/strong>: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (c), Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (wk), Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav, Khaleel Ahmed<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pitch report<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The average score, at SCG, is 221 and 187 in the first and second innings respectively.
