Premadasa stadium Pitch Report for Sri Lanka vs Australia Match<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sri Lanka derailed from 101 for 1 to 128 all out, and the misfortune continued in the second innings as well. Surprisingly, none of the spinners from either side took a wicket. The Australian pacers stole the show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect a batter-dominating show, that is, if Sri Lanka do not gift wrap wickets in a cluster.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Probable Playing XI for Sri Lanka &amp; Australia <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Sri Lanka<\/strong>: Danushka Gunathilaka, Pathum Nissanka, Charith Asalanka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dasun Shanaka (c), Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Maheesh Theekshana, Nuwan Thushara<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Australia<\/strong>: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade (wk), Ashton Agar, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, Josh Hazlewood<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also Read:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/how-to-choose-a-captain-for-your-fantasy-cricket-team\/\"><em>How to pick captain for your fantasy cricket team<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/india-vs-south-africa-1st-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\"><em>India vs South Africa Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Players for Sri Lanka vs Australia Match <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Warner<\/strong>\u2019s average shot up to 65 after yesterday\u2019s unbeaten innings of 70* off 44. This was his fifth consecutive 50-plus score against them. Enough said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pathum Nissanka<\/strong> gave the desired start his team was hoping for from him, against quality and experienced pace attack. Although his strike rate is a bit on the lower side, an average of 32 in 7 innings against Australia is encouraging enough for the fantasy players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josh Hazlewood<\/strong> continued his spectacular T20 form. He registered his fourth four-wicket haul in T20Is: he took one wicket in the powerplay and three in the middle overs. In his last four competitive T20 games, he has taken 11 wickets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart Picks&nbsp;for Sri Lanka vs Australia Match<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two of <strong>Mitchell Starc<\/strong>\u2019s three wickets came at the death. He bowled as full as he could, leaving little room for the Sri Lankan tail to attack him. In the format in Sri Lanka, he has taken 7 wickets at 12.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Finch<\/strong> looked rusty, which often is the case with him, but managed to score runs at a strike rate of 153. His 61* runs included 4 fours and as many sixes. It is unlikely that he will change his approach. He either attacks or perishes. In his last 10 competitive innings, he has three fifties and six scores below 15 runs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danushka Gunathilaka<\/strong> has been playing only T20 cricket since February. In his last 10 innings, he has managed 212 runs including three scores above 35 runs. He looked in good touch last evening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It was unfortunate to not see <strong>Glenn Maxwell<\/strong> unfold his magic with the bat. Against Sri Lanka, the Big Show has smashed 424 runs at 61 including the highest score of 145*.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the scorecard suggests that <strong>Charith Asalanka<\/strong> struggled to boost the run rate, it is important to note that he was playing against a disciplined bowling attack. He scored two boundaries in his 38-run knock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wanindu Hasaranga<\/strong>, the second-highest wicket-taker of the Indian T20 League, went wicketless for the first time in his last 10 innings. He did bowl a few tough deliveries, but the Australian openers were too good on the day for his mystery spin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maheesh Theekshana<\/strong>, however, was given the utmost respect by Warner and Finch. Although he went wicketless, he conceded a mere 25 runs in 4 overs amidst a rampage. His trick deliveries are difficult to decipher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sri Lanka vs Australia 2nd T20I Match Preview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Australia played like the World Champions. Despite being put on the backfoot at the start of the game, they managed to gain momentum and finished off the task in an emphatic way. On the other hand, Sri Lanka will rue their mishap in the middle overs and the lack of intent with the ball. The hosts will have to punch well above their weight to level the series.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong>: June 8, 7 PM IST<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"6824\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
