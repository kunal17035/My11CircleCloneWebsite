Against Sri Lanka in the opening game, she took 3for 25. She is the No.1 bowler in ICC T20Is Rankings for a reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the England series, <strong>Laura Wolvaardt<\/strong> has scored three fifties, one forty, and two twenties in seven white-ball games. Against England, she has one fifty in six T20I innings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chloe Tryon<\/strong>\u2019s 39 off 17 kept South Africa in the hunt until she got run out. She hit three fours and as many sixes, toying with the New Zealand bowlers. She, as a matter of fact, has been hitting runs consistently of late. In the ODIs against England last month, she registered 88 and 70.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nat Sciver<\/strong>\u2019s ability to score runs at a brisk rate and pick wickets at crucial intervals makes her a popular player in fantasy cricket. Against South Africa, she has a fifty, two thirties, and six wickets to her name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also Read:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/west-indies-vs-india-2nd-t20i-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-team\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">West Indies vs India 2nd T20I Fantasy Cricket Team<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks for England Women vs South Africa Women&#8217;s Match  <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katherine Brunt<\/strong> has a reasonable record against South Africa. She has taken 14 wickets in 13 T20Is, including a four-wicket haul last month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sune Luus<\/strong>, after six consecutive single-digit scores, went bonkers with a knock of 32 off 18. Demoting herself from No.3 to 6 has worked in her favour. Her highest score against England read 63*.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In her last five T20Is, <strong>N Mlaba<\/strong> has taken seven wickets, comprising the three-wicket haul against England last month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Heather Knight<\/strong> averages 36 against South Africa, scoring four twenties and a thirty. In her last five T20Is, she has two thirties and a twenty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ayabonga Khaka<\/strong> has taken two three-wicket hauls in five T20Is against England. She is South Africa\u2019s premier strike bowler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was <strong>Alice Capsey<\/strong>\u2019s 44 off 45 that kept England in the hunt in a stuttering chase of 107 against Sri Lanka. It was only her third T20I, and she showed nerves of steel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>England Women vs South Africa Women Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>England drubbed South Africa 3-0 last month at home. Overall, they have won 18 of 21 T20Is against South Africa. The overall team combination and the recent performances keep them ahead in the race. South Africa will have to, especially, bowl with great discipline to put England on the back foot.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7524\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
