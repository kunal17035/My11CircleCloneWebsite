Amidst 73 wickets that went down (9 per innings), 4 centuries and 6 fifties were also registered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 17 August, 3.30 PM IST<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Probable Playing XIs for England &amp; South Africa: <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Playing XI for England:<\/strong> Zak Crawley, Alex Lees, Ollie Pope, Joe Root (c), Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes, Ben Foakes (wk), Matty Potts, Jack Leach, James Anderson, Stuart Broad<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for South Africa:<\/strong> Dean Elgar (c), Aiden Markram, Sarel Erwee, Keegan Petersen, Rassie van der Dussen, Kyle Verreynne (wk), Keshav Maharaj, Marco Jansen, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada\/Lungi Ngidi, Glenton Stuurman<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the ongoing English summer, <strong>Joe Root<\/strong> averages 114, including three centuries and a fifty. Against South Africa, he has amassed 1,164 runs at 53 in 12 Tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, <strong>Jonny Bairstow<\/strong> too has looked invincible with the bat. In the last three Tests at home, he has smashed four centuries, including two in the Birmingham Test against India. When South Africa last visited England in 2017, he added 330 runs in 4 Tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Africa will be aware of <strong>James Anderson<\/strong>\u2019s<strong> <\/strong>threat, especially with the new ball. He has bagged 17 wickets in the last 3 Tests at home, including a six-wicket haul against New Zealand at Lord\u2019s earlier this season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ben Stokes<\/strong> loves playing against South Africa and will be a huge favourite in fantasy leagues for his dual ability. In 12 Tests against the Proteas, he has collected 1,028, including the highest score of 258, and has taken 29 wickets. He has also pouched 26 catches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also Read:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/zimbabwe-vs-india-1st-odi-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">India vs Zimbabwe Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/west-indies-vs-new-zealand-1st-odi-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">West Indies vs New Zealand, 1st ODI Fantasy Tips<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/india-vs-pakistan-head-to-head-t20-stats\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">India vs Pakistan Head to Head in T20<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/pros-and-cons-of-creating-multiple-fantasy-cricket-teams\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Pros and cons of making multiple fantasy teams<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ben Foakes<\/strong> can be a useful pick in the wicketkeeper category. Besides adding 203 runs in his last 5 Tests, he has also inflicted 19 dismissals with the gloves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While <strong>Stuart Broad<\/strong> has shown signs of slight decline, he has taken 75 wickets in 22 Tests against South Africa. His ability to pick wickets in a cluster can make a huge difference in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/\">fantasy cricket<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Kagiso Rabada misses out, <strong>Anrich Nortje<\/strong> will have to lead the pace attack for South Africa. When he last played against England in the three-match Test series in 2020, he ended up taking 13 wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the year, <strong>Dean Elgar<\/strong> has accumulated 438 runs in 6 Tests, including the highest score of 96*. When he last toured England in 2017, he got one century and two fifties in 4 Tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aiden Markram<\/strong> might have managed only 149 runs in his last 5 Tests, but South Africa will need him to get amongst the runs on this tour of England. His slip-catching, nonetheless, can generate handy fantasy points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rassie van der Dussen<\/strong> will be playing his first Test in England. However, when they toured South Africa for a four-match Test series in 2020, he got three half-centuries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Form Concern<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although England continue to show faith in <strong>Zak Crawley<\/strong>, his form will be a matter of worry. He has been dismissed for a single-digit score on seven occasions in his last 5 Tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>England vs South Africa, 1st Test Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>England have won four Tests at home this summer and have also emerged victorious in their last three Tests against South Africa. Moreover, when the two sides last met at the Lord\u2019s in 2017, the hosts won by 211 runs. Recent form and numbers are strongly in favour of England.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7825\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
