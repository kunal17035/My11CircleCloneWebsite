In the last three games, only four batters could get past the 50-run mark. Recent history also suggests that it hasn\u2019t been a happy hunting venue for the spinners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 27 July, 7.00 PM IST<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Probable XIs for Scotland &amp; New Zealand <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Scotland<\/strong>: Kyle Coetzer, Matthew Cross (wk), George Munsey, Callum Macleod, Richie Berrington (c), Michael Leask, Chris Greaves, Mark Watt, Safyaan Sharif, Alasdair Evans, Hamza Tahir<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Playing XI for New Zealand<\/strong>: Martin Guptill, Finn Allen, Dane Cleaver (wk), Glenn Phillips, Daryl Mitchell, James Neesham, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner (c), Ish Sodhi, Lockie Ferguson, Jacob Duffy<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players for the Match<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Martin Guptill <\/strong>could only muscle 60 runs, including two scores in twenties, in the three T20Is against Ireland. However, his overall white-ball form in 2022 and especially the numbers against Scotland are encouraging. When he last played against them in November 2021, he smashed 93 off 56 balls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like he rattled the Netherlands, <strong>Lockie Ferguson<\/strong> will be itching to let it rip against Scotland as well. He has bagged 17 wickets in his last 10 T20Is, including the best figures of 5 for 21. He averages an impressive 13 in his relatively young T20I career.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Bracewell<\/strong> has turned out to be a messiah for New Zealand lately, especially in white-ball cricket. He has already registered a couple of match-winning performances for his side. He scored 211 runs and took 5 wickets on the recent tour of Ireland.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong> <strong>for Scotland vs New Zealand, 1st T20I<\/strong> <strong>Match<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Richie Berrington <\/strong>went through a lean patch (8 runs in 4 games) in the recently concluded ODI tri-series against Nepal and Namibia. However, he has the ability and the experience to turn it around and make a difference for his team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Neesham<\/strong> might not be a marquee name in fantasy leagues, but he often helps fantasy players nudge ahead with his all-round effort. In the series against Ireland, he added 53 runs and picked 2 wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hamza Tahir<\/strong> finished the tri-series with 9 wickets in 4 games, including the best figures of 4 for 26 against Nepal. For Scotland, he could be the go-to man for wickets, especially in the middle overs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, <strong>Callum MacLeod<\/strong> could only accumulate 115 runs in 10 innings in T20Is. However, Scotland would hope that he can continue his recent purple patch with the bat. He has smashed 3 half-centuries in his last 4 ODIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Safyaan Sharif<\/strong> has a happy knack for picking wickets in white-ball cricket. He is not threteningly fast but uses his gentle variations to dismiss the batters. He took 8 wickets in the T20 World Cup last year. He also has a four-wicket haul at Edinburgh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a number of years, <strong>Ish Sodhi<\/strong> has been a smart operator in limited-overs cricket. In the recent tour of Ireland, he finished with 8 wickets, including the best figures of 3 for 21 in the second T20I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Zealand\u2019s new recruit, <strong>Dane Cleaver,<\/strong> turned out to be the surprise package against Ireland. The wicketkeeper added 88 runs and inflicted 5 dismissals with the gloves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barring a knock of 48 and a solitary wicket in the final T20I against Ireland, <strong>Daryl Mitchell<\/strong> couldn\u2019t impose himself much. That said, his recent form with the bat augurs well for his team and fantasy players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/nellai-vs-chepauk-qualifier-1-tamil-nadu-t20-league-2022-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nellai vs Chepauk, Qualifier 1 Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Match Preview for Scotland vs New Zealand, 1st T20I Match  <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Only 2 T20Is have taken place between both teams, and New Zealand have won both.
