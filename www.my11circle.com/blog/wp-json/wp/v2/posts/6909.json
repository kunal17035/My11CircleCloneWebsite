Batters with resilience and patience are more likely to succeed on this pitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teams<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for West Indies<\/strong>: Kraigg Brathwaite (c), John Campbell, Devon Thomas, Nkrumah Bonner, Jermaine Blackwood, Raymon Reifer\/Gundakesh Motie, Kyle Mayers, Joshua Da Silva (wk), Alzarri Joseph, Anderson Phillip, Jayden Seales<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Bangladesh<\/strong>: Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Tamim Iqbal, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Mominul Haque, Shakib Al Hasan (c), Litton Das (wk), Mosaddek Hossain, Mehidy Hasan, Taijul Islam\/Khaled Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Ebadot Hossain<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shakib Al Hasan<\/strong> is the highest wicket-taker in Tests between Bangladesh and West Indies. His 46 wickets have come at an average of 25, including three five-wicket hauls. With the bat, he has managed 813 runs at an average of 45.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kraigg Brathwaite<\/strong>\u2019s numbers for the opening game make him a strong candidate for captaincy in fantasy cricket. He has scored the most runs at the venue: 635 runs in 8 Tests including two hundreds and three fifties. Against Bangladesh, he has managed 817 runs in 10 Tests comprising three hundreds and as many fifties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The king pair against Sri Lanka last month was a rare relapse for <strong>Tamim Iqbal<\/strong>. Before that, in four competitive games, he had scores of 90, 109*, 137, and 133. In addition, his numbers are strong against West Indies: 853 runs containing a hundred and six fifties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alzarri Joseph<\/strong> will lead the pace attack in the absence of Kemar Roach. At the venue, Joseph has shot down 13 wickets in 4 Tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Litton Das<\/strong>\u2019 scores against Sri Lanka last month read 88, 52, and 142. Against the West Indies, he has three fifties in five games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jermaine Blackwood<\/strong> recently scored a First-Class hundred for Jamaica. In his last Test against England earlier this year, he had scored a splendid hundred under pressure. The onus of managing the middle and lower-middle order will be on him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mustafizur Rahman<\/strong> has been in and out of the team due to injuries, and will be returning to the longest format after more than a year. In 14 matches, he has taken 30 wickets at an average of 37.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The West Indian middle order is vulnerable against spin and this is where <strong>Mehidy Hasan<\/strong> will take the centre stage. In 6 Tests against West Indies, he has bagged as many as 35 wickets at an average of 20. Interestingly, he has also scored a hundred against them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Campbell<\/strong>\u2019s last five First-Class scores read 48, 37, 98, and 2. His concern, however, is that he fails to convert his starts. He averages a mere 24 in 18 Tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kyle Mayers<\/strong> was in good touch on the tour of the Netherlands. He scored his maiden ODI hundred in the final game. In Tests, he has been improving at a fast rate. He already has a double-hundred against Bangladesh. With the ball, he has bagged 20 wickets in 11 games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>West Indies have won the last four Tests against Bangladesh at home. More importantly, they won these games by a big margin. However, West Indies lack experience in their bowling department. Their inability to tackle spin could make matters worse for them. That being said, Bangladesh will have to be disciplined in such alien conditions. Form and fortune do not take time to change in Test cricket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong>: June 16, 7:30 PM IST<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"6909\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
