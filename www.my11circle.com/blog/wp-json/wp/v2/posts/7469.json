Recent history suggests that the pitch has encouraged batters in executing their shots. Spinners, though, have struggled to make an impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Teams<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for New Zealand:<\/strong> Suzie Bates, Sophie Devine (c), Maddy Green, Amelia Kerr, Hayley Jensen, Brooke Halliday, Izzy Gaze (wk), Lea Tahuhu, Hannah Rowe, Rosemary Mair, Fran Jonas<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for South Africa:<\/strong> Anneke Bosch, Lara Goodall, Sune Luus (c), Laura Wolvaardt, Mignon du Preez, Chloe Tryon, Nadine de Klerk, Trisha Chetty (wk), Shabnim Ismail, Masabata Klaas, Ayabonga Khaka<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Women\u2019s Invitational Tournament in May, <strong>Sophie Devine<\/strong> scored 213 runs, including 2 half-centuries in 7 games. She also slammed 105 off 65 when these two sides last met in the format in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like her teammate, <strong>Suzie Bates<\/strong> too had a decent outing (146 runs at 36) in the Fairbreak Invitational Tournament. Against South Africa, she has accumulated 426 runs at an impressive average of 53, including the highest score of 124*.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anneke Bosch<\/strong> has had a rollicking start to her T20I career. With 96 runs in 3 innings, she finished the England series as the leading run-getter. Overall, she has already collected 293 runs at 36, including 2 half-centuries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the limited-overs tour to England, <strong>Laura Wolvaardt<\/strong> appeared in fine touch with the willow by scoring 4 half-centuries in 7 innings. South Africa will hope that their prime batter can continue her purple patch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amelia Kerr<\/strong> hasn\u2019t played competitive cricket since the ODI World Cup. However, she will keep fantasy players interested with her dual ability. She has added 116 runs and taken 4 wickets in her last 5 T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lee Tahuhu<\/strong> might have gone wicketless on 5 out of 6 occasions against South Africa in the format, but she will remain the No.1 strike bowler with the new ball for New Zealand. Not too long ago, she picked three three-wicket hauls in the ODI World Cup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Along with Tahuhu, <strong>Hayley Jensen<\/strong> will also have a big role to play with the ball. She has bagged 8 wickets, including the best figures of 3 for 28 in 6 games against South Africa in T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the England tour, <strong>Ayabonga Khaka<\/strong> showed glimpses of getting back to her best. She managed to pick 5 wickets in her last 4 white-ball games. South Africa will bank on her experience for early breakthroughs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lara Goodall<\/strong> can be a dark horse in fantasy leagues with the bat. Besides being dismissed for a single-digit score twice, she has also registered scores of 52, 48, and 42 in her last 5 T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both sides have met 11 times in the format, out of which New Zealand have won 9 and South Africa 2. Moreover, South Africa are also coming into this tournament after being drubbed 3-0 by England last week. On the other hand, New Zealand have a well-balanced team and will start as the favourites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 30 July, 4.30 PM IST<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7469\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
