The pacers have had a good time, taking 28 of 42 wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Chennai blasted 202 for 2 on Sunday, it was their shot selection that made the batting look easy. They started slow and accelerated in the middle order, reading the conditions well. Attacking without a plan may wreak havoc on the batters at the venue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong>: May 4, 7:30 PM<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Probable Playing XIs for Bangalore &amp; Chennai<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/cricket-teams\/bangalore-team\/\">Bangalore<\/a><\/strong>: Faf du Plessis* (c), Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, Glenn Maxwell*, Shahbaz Ahmed, Mahipal Lomror, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Wanindu Hasaranga*, Harshal Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dwayne Bravo was unfit and hence was rested against Hyderabad. There, however, is no news on whether he has regained his full fitness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/cricket-teams\/chennai-team\/\">Chennai<\/a><\/strong>: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devon Conway*, Robin Uthappa, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (c &amp; wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Moeen Ali\/Dwayne Bravo\/Mitchell Santner*, Dwaine Pretorius*, Maheesh Theekshana, Simarjeet Singh, Mukesh Choudhary<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Players for Bangalore vs Chennai Match<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruturaj Gaikwad\u2019s technique and composure came to his rescue. He batted as if he had no memory of his poor form, and scripted an innings of substance. His 99 runs included 6 sixes and as many fours. As a matter of fact, his both fifties have come at Pune, his home ground. The highest run-scorer of 2021 is back to his sublime best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same cannot be said for Virat Kohli, who scored his first fifty of the season after 9 games. He took 53 deliveries to stitch a knock of 58 runs, scoring 6 fours and a six. That being said, runs finally came from the maestro\u2019s willow. If we are to compare forms, he has collected more runs than Rohit Sharma, another <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/tournaments\/indian-t20-league\/\">Indian T20 League<\/a> great. If anything, both forms and fortune gradually and eventually change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also Read:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/delhi-vs-hyderabad-indian-t20-league-2022-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\">Delhi vs Hyderabad, Fantasy Cricket Tips<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart Picks&nbsp;for Bangalore vs Chennai Match <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the uninitiated, Devon Conway averages 50.1 in 20 T20 Internationals. These numbers are exceptional for a batter who plays up the order. His performance against Hyderabad was no surprise for the cricket experts. He remained unbeaten on 85* off 55, coupling his smart strokeplay with powerful hits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/player\/login#register?utm_source=m1c_blogpost_register&amp;utm_medium=organic\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"729\" height=\"90\" src=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner.jpg 729w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner-300x37.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner-696x86.jpg 696w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/win-1-crore-register-banner-150x19.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With 15 wickets in 10 games, Wanindu Hasaranga is the highest wicket-taker for Bangalore. He dismissed the likes of Robin Uthappa and Ravindra Jadeja in the previous contest between these teams. In the same game, Maheesh Theekshana picked up a spectacular four-wicket haul, trapping the Bangalore batters in a maze with his wily spin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wicket has everything on offer for Josh Hazelwood. The disciplined bowler has sniped up 10 wickets in six games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dwayne Bravo\u2019s deceitful bowling makes him a popular pick in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/\">fantasy cricket<\/a>. His 14 wickets have come at a strike rate of 12.7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ambati Rayudu\u2019s last three innings read 46, 40, and 78. He has a reputation for scoring runs in times of trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Key Battles<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mukesh Choudhary has a four-for and three-for in the last three games. The emerging pacer does the bulk of the damage in the powerplay, swinging the ball late. He will be up against the experienced opening duo of Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ravindra Jadeja has dismissed Glenn Maxwell as many as 6 times in the league. In addition, three of Jadeja\u2019s five wickets in the edition have come against Bengaluru.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Form Concerns<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Barring his 88 and 96, Faf du Plessis does not have anything to brag about. In the remaining 8 games, he has managed a mere 94 runs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bangalore vs Chennai Match Preview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bangalore have lost the last three games, while Chennai have won two. Although the points table suggests that Bangalore are ahead in the race, Chennai seem to have gained momentum after an ordinary start and amidst the change in captaincy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put things into perspective, it\u2019s going to be a crackerjack of a contest for fantasy players. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready for Bangalore vs Chennai Match?
