Of the 21 wickets that fell, 9 belonged to the spinners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teams<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for West Indies<\/strong>: Shai Hope (wk), Brandon King, Kyle Mayers, Shamarh Brooks, Nicholas Pooran (c), Rovman Powell, Keemo Paul, Anderson Philip, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Jayden Seales<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Bangladesh<\/strong>: Tamim Iqbal, Litton Das, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah (c), Afif Hossain, Nurul Hasan (wk), Mosaddek Hossain, Mahedi Hasan\/Mehidy Hasan, Nasum Ahmed, Shoriful Islam\/Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his last six ODIs, <strong>Shai Hope<\/strong> has scored two hundreds. Against Bangladesh, he averages 94: he has scored three hundreds and as many fifties in the last six games. Talk about numbers!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tamim Iqbal<\/strong>\u2019s last five scores against West Indies read 18, 48, 44, 50, and 64. Moreover, his both hundred against the West Indies have come in their own den.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unbeaten 74* in the final T20I was one of the best innings he played for West Indies, said <strong>Nicholas Pooran<\/strong>. After becoming the limited-overs captain, Pooran has added a touch of maturity to his aggressive approach. To make matters more interesting, he took 4 for 48 in his last ODI, against Pakistan last month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his 12-ODI career, <strong>Shamarh Brooks<\/strong> has already scored a hundred and three fifties. He likes playing at his own pace, and batting at No.3 helps his approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Litton Das<\/strong> has been an all-or-nothing batter of late. He scored an attractive 49 in the final T20I after consecutive failures in the first two games. For Bangladesh to start the innings well, Litton will have to play with patience and gradually build the innings. He has the highest score of 94* against the West Indies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alzarri Joseph<\/strong> has taken 9 wickets in the last five ODIs. He is a natural strike bowler, taking wickets with both new and old ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mahmudullah<\/strong> averages a whopping 63 against West Indies in the format. He has scored five fifties, of which four are unbeaten.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kyle Mayers<\/strong> followed his hundred in the Test series with a fifty in the T20Is. He hasn\u2019t had much trouble dominating the Bangladeshi bowlers. In addition to his impressive batting, he also provides fantasy points with his medium pace.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keemo Paul<\/strong> is back in the West Indies setup after putting up consistent performances in domestic cricket. He scored 21 runs and took 2 for 57 in the only game he got against Pakistan last month. Expect the all-rounder to fetch you fantasy points with his all-round skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mustafizur Rahman<\/strong>\u2019s recent form may be a bit concerning, but his ODI numbers are super encouraging. He strikes at 27.5, maintaining an economy of 5 RPO. Against the West Indies, he has taken 25 wickets in 13 games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Afif Hossain<\/strong> has scored two fifties in his last five ODI innings. Just recently he bailed Bangladesh out, lifting them from 28 for 5 to a winning position of 219 for 6 against Afghanistan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>West Indies have lost their last 8 ODIs against Bangladesh, of which 3 came at a neutral venue. At home, they lead by 8-5. Although Bangladesh have lost all games on the tour, they have talented ODI cricketers at their disposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong>: July 10, 7 PM IST&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7097\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
