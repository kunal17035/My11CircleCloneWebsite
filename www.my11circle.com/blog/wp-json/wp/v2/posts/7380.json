In the second Test, Australia fell prey to spin that changed the complexion of the game. On the other hand, Pakistan pulled off an improbable chase in the same conditions. To put things into perspective, the team that plays spin well stays ahead in the race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teams<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Sri Lanka<\/strong>: Oshada Fernando, Dimuth Karunaratne (c), Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Dinesh Chandimal, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Ramesh Mendis, Maheesh Theekshana, Prabath Jayasuriya, Kasun Rajitha<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaheen Afridi has been ruled out due to knee injury.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Pakistan<\/strong>: Abdullah Shafique, Imam-ul-Haq, Azhar Ali, Babar Azam (c), Agha Salman, Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Yasir Shah, Hasan Ali, Faheem Ashraf, Naseem Shah<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Abdullah Shafique<\/strong> has been a part of the Ultimate Team on My11Circle in all his six Tests. He has scored two hundreds and four fifties. His remaining five scores read 25, 44, 13, 27, and 13. To further glorify him, he averages 119 in the fourth innings: his scores are 73, 96, 27, and 160. He\u2019s a man for all occasions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Galle, <strong>Prabath Jayasuriya<\/strong> has taken 21 wickets at 19 in two Tests, including a four-wicket and three five-wicket hauls. He knows the nook and cranny of the venue and thrives on bowling for longer periods<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his last three Tests, <strong>Babar Azam<\/strong> has scored two hundreds and four fifties. Sandwiched between these Test innings are three hundreds and a fifty in ODIs and a fifty in a T20I. His form in 2022 has been \u2013 for the lack of a better word \u2013 outstanding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Galle, <strong>Dinesh Chandimal<\/strong> has four hundreds \u2013 of which one was a double-hundred against Australia \u2013 and four fifties in 16 Tests. In 2022, he has scored 618 runs at an average of 124.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the series, <strong>Kusal Mendis<\/strong> had not scored a fifty against Pakistan in four games and averaged a mere 15. However, his knocks against Australia charged his confidence and it showed in his approach in the first Test. He managed scores of 21 and 76, displaying resilience and temperament.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the venue, <strong>Yasir Shah<\/strong>\u2019s bowling figures read 2 for 79, 7 for 76, 2 for 66, and 3 for 122. Given how wickets have been falling at regular intervals lately, his batting skills may come handy. He has a hundred to his credit in the format: 113 vs Australia at Adelaide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mohammad Nawaz<\/strong> not only shone with the ball and took a five-for in the second innings but also made a significant impact for both Pakistan and fantasy players with an unbeaten knock of 19 during the tough chase. For that matter, he has 6 hundreds and 15 fifties in First-Class cricket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mohammad Rizwan<\/strong> pouched 5 catches and scored 59 runs in the Test. On the other hand, Sri Lanka\u2019s wicketkeeper <strong>Niroshan Dickwella<\/strong> had an ordinary time due to a fault of his own. When Sri Lanka needed him the most, he decided to play a reverse-sweep and in the process induced an under-edge which went on to hit the stumps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Imam-ul-Haq<\/strong> averages 58 in 2022 compared to his overall average of 34. It was his 87-run opening stand with Shafique that laid the stage for Pakistan\u2019s historic win. His impressive ability to play spin by using his feet well has been a big advantage for his team of late.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also Read: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/west-indies-vs-india-1st-odi-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\">West Indies vs India 1st ODI: Fantasy Cricket Team<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pakistan have been batting well as a cohesive unit of late. In addition to Babar\u2019s class, the consistency of Shafique and Imam-ul-Haq at the top has been an icing on the cake. If not that, their bowlers \u2013 spinners and pacers alike \u2013 have also been performing in tandem. Although Sri Lanka gained momentum from the win against Australia, they still have a few chinks in their armour. They again face the pressure of levelling the series.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time<\/strong>: July 24, 10 AM IST<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7380\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
