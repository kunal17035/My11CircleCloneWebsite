After picking her second four-wicket haul of the tournament against Barbados, she has become the leading wicket-taker (9) of the Games. With an impressive economy of 6 in 3 games, she has also generated bonus fantasy points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Harmanpreet Kaur<\/strong> started off the tournament with a bang by smashing a 34-ball half-century against Australia. Against England in the format, she has collected 142 runs at 35 in her last 5 innings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like Renuka, <strong>Alice Capsey<\/strong> too has been a surprise package. Batting at No.3, she has been consistently laying a strong foundation at the top. Her tournament scores read 44, 50, and 23.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 8 T20Is in a row, <strong>Sophie Ecclestone<\/strong> has at least picked one wicket. By bagging another 5 in the ongoing tournament, she is leading the wicket-taking charts for her team. When she last bowled against India in the format in July, she finished with a match-defining spell of 3 for 36.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was <strong>Katherine Brunt<\/strong>\u2019s new-ball spell of 3-1-4-2 that broke the back of New Zealand\u2019s top order. She had also scored a valuable 38 off 23 balls to propel England\u2019s score to 167 against South Africa earlier in the tournament. Against India, she has taken 22 wickets in 17 T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India will hope that <strong>Shefali Verma<\/strong> can continue her decent run with the bat in the semi-finals as well. Till now, she has collected 107 runs at 35, including the highest score of 48, and has also picked a wicket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danielle Wyatt<\/strong> hasn\u2019t set the stage on fire just yet (1, 27, and 5), but she will have fond memories of her match-winning knock of 89* off 56 balls that helped England win the T20I series against India last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a failure against Australia, <strong>Jemimah Rodrigues<\/strong> responded by scoring 56* off 46 balls against Barbados. Just when India experienced a mini-wobble at 92 for 4, she formed a handy partnership with <strong>Deepti Sharma<\/strong> (34 off 28 balls) and ensured India got past the 160-run mark. Meanwhile, Deepti has picked up 2 wickets against Australia and bowled an economical spell against Pakistan earlier in the competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sophia Dunkley<\/strong> might have added only 37 runs in this tournament, but she is always going to be a threat at the top, as we saw in the recently concluded bilateral series against South Africa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India will hope their best batter <strong>Smriti Mandhana <\/strong>can come to the party in the knockout match against England. She averages 36 against them in the format. She has already slammed an unbeaten 63 in this tournament.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/nae.my11circle.com\/download?utm_source=m1c_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-homepage\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"86\" src=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/t20-play-with-champion-download-now-4-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7693\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/t20-play-with-champion-download-now-4-3.jpg 696w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/t20-play-with-champion-download-now-4-3-300x37.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/t20-play-with-champion-download-now-4-3-150x19.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2> <strong>England Women vs India Women<\/strong> <strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While England topped Group B by remaining unbeaten in all their three games, India finished second in Group A after winning two out of three matches.
