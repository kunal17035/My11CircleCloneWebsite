It is perhaps an indication as to how difficult chasing has been amidst the regular fall of wickets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> 4 August, 3.30 PM IST<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Teams<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for South Africa:<\/strong> Anneke Bosch, Tazmin Brits, Mignon du Preez, Laura Wolvaardt, Chloe Tryon, Sune Luus (c), Nadine de Klerk, Sinalo Jafta (wk), Shabnim Ismail, Ayabonga Khaka, Nonkululeko Mlaba<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for Sri Lanka:<\/strong> Vishmi Gunaratne, Chamari Athapaththu (c), Hasini Perera, Nilakshi de Silva, Kavisha Dilhari, Anushka Sanjeewani (wk), Harshitha Madavi, Ama Kanchana, Oshadi Ranasinghe, Sugandika Kumari, Inoka Ranaweera<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sri Lanka might have lost both games in this tournament, but the spin duo of <strong>Inoka Ranaweera<\/strong> and <strong>Oshadi Ranasinghe<\/strong> have continued their impressive run with the ball. While Ranaweera has taken consecutive three-wicket hauls, Ranasinghe has picked consecutive two-wicket hauls. Together, they have bagged 31 wickets in their last 10 T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fantasy players will continue to pin hopes on <strong>Laura Wolvaardt<\/strong> for quick runs at the top. Her recent scores in the format read 41*, 28, 13, 21, and 55.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also Read:<\/span><\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/asia-cup-2022-full-schedule-venue-teams-and-format\/\">Asia Cup 2022 Schedule<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/zimbabwe-vs-bangladesh-1st-odi-todays-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-tips\/\">Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh, 1st ODI Fantasy Tips<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amidst Sri Lanka\u2019s erratic performances<strong>, Nilakshi de Silva<\/strong> has been extremely consistent in her run-making in white-ball cricket. Lately, she has been relatively successful in resurrecting the innings in the middle overs with scores of 36, 25 and 30.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being dismissed for a duck against New Zealand, <strong>Chamari Athapaththu<\/strong> will be keen on adding some useful runs for her side against South Africa. She had the top scores of 80* and 43 against India in T20Is last month. Given this is an inconsequential game, she might cut loose and put up an encore of her best performances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Although South Africa have not been clinical, <strong>Chloe Tryon <\/strong>and <strong>Sune Luus<\/strong> have shown positive intent in getting runs on the board. They even put on a brave partnership against New Zealand. Together they have accumulated 96 runs in the tournament. In the past, the experienced duo have also broken threatening partnerships with the ball.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anneke Bosch<\/strong> (32) and <strong>Tazmin Brit<\/strong> (38) added 64 runs for the first wicket in a tough chase of 168 runs. In addition to her fantastic knock, Anneke picked up a wicket. For that matter, both have been generating fantasy points consistently. They scored a fifty each in the T20I series against England last month. South Africa will hope for another solid opening stand from these two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nonkululeko Mlaba<\/strong> has been South Africa\u2019s best bowler of late. She has taken five wickets in the last three T20Is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Form Concern<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just when it appeared that <strong>Ayabonga Khaka<\/strong> was getting back to her best rhythm on the tour of England, she seems to be experiencing a poor run with the ball all over again. Not only has she gone wicketless in her last three T20Is, but she has also been a bit uneconomical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Match Preview<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both South Africa and Sri Lanka have failed to put their best foot forward in this tournament, owing to which they are at the bottom of the points table with two defeats in as many games. On the head-to-head front, South Africa lead Sri Lanka 9-3. While this contest is pretty much going to be inconsequential, both teams would be keen on finishing off on a positive note.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7604\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have opted for a fantasy cricket team based on the recent performances, overall impact, and credit points.
