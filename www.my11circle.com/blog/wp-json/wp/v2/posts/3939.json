Social chatter has now become a thing of trend. Online Gaming garners a lot of attention. And it then translates into a lot of myths. You see a lot of pictures on the web saying \u2018proven\u2019. And come across a lot of posts that make you believe in how \u2018you can win every fantasy football match\u2019. Let us break it to you \u2013 You DON\u2019T win all the time. Here are a few other things that the internet has made you believe about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/\">fantasy football,<\/a> but we\u2019ll just announce the realities right here \u2013<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Myth #1 \u2013 If you\u2019re a fan of football, you\u2019ll absolutely win the Football Fantasy Matches \u2013<\/em><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reality: We get it. You love watching the tournaments. You\u2019ve been giving the sport a lot of attention, time, and energy for years now. When it comes to fantasy football, you\u2019re probably one of those players who makes a spreadsheet including stats about the form, performance, and previous matches of the players. But trust us, none of this secures a win. Fantasy Football matches are real-time, and moreover, preparation never secures a sure-fire win. You get better at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/\">playing fantasy sports<\/a> only with time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Myth #2 \u2013 Stick to a single plan while choosing the team<\/em><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reality: If you stick to one way of picking players, you\u2019ll always end up using the same strategy and that doesn\u2019t work in fantasy football matches. In any league of 12 players, you get to pick 1 in every round. Which simply means that 11 people out of 12 are not going to be in your hands. We\u2019re not saying you shouldn\u2019t have a plan. But be able to adjust it so that you\u2019re not left thinking what you could have done right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Myth #3 \u2013 If they have the same Bye Week, avoid them<\/em><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reality: There are a lot of good fantasy players out there who don\u2019t include Bye weeks in their plan because they don\u2019t want to fall for this myth. Firstly, you\u2019ll have to assume that every player is on the roster and in a healthy form whenever bye weeks are rolling around. There could be many poor performances, trades, injuries \u2013 a lot of your draftees\/players won\u2019t be relevant. Worry about the tournament at hand and let the bye weeks take your time only when they\u2019re closer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Myth #4 \u2013 There are a few players you MUST start every tournament with<\/em><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reality: Sure, there are a few players who play more frequently than the others, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019d follow their blueprint. Moreover, fantasy football is about making the best team within the budget. Every major line-up of winners won\u2019t have that one player, the list is very dynamic. Don\u2019t try to jump on the hype train \u2013 make informed decisions instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, while we hope we could help you debunk a few myths, don\u2019t get lost in the chatter around and keep practicing on My11Circle <a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-cricket-app.html\">fantasy league app<\/a> to become better at fantasy football every SINGLE day!<br><\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"3939\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Opinions are not facts.
