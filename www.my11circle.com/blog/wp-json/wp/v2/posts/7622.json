In the same period, the average first and second innings scores read 166 and 133 respectively as 6.3 wickets fell per innings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time:<\/strong> August 6, 8.00 PM IST<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Probable Playing XIs for West Indies &amp; India <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probable XI for West Indies<\/strong>: Brandon King, Kyle Mayers, Shimron Hetmyer, Rovman Powell, Nicholas Pooran (c &amp; wk), Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Odean Smith\/Romario Shepherd, Keemo Paul\/Dominic Drakes, Alzarri Joseph, Obed McCoy<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rohit Sharma suffered a back spasm in the last match. While some reports suggest that he has recovered, it remains to be seen if he actually takes the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Playing XI for India<\/strong>: Rohit Sharma(c), Rishabh Pant (wk), Shreyas Iyer, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Dinesh Karthik, Deepak Hooda, Ravindra Jadeja\/Ravi Bishnoi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ravichandran Ashwin, Arshdeep Singh<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Power Players<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav <\/strong>put on an exhibition of exquisite strokeplay in his innings of 76 off 44 balls in the third T20I. It is his self-belief that makes him fearless in this form of the game. He might be relatively young in international cricket, but he has already managed a hundred and 5 half-centuries in the format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be it with the bat or ball, <strong>Hardik Pandya <\/strong>has been finding ways to keep fantasy players happy. While his services with the bat weren\u2019t required much at St Kitts, he bowled his full quota of overs by conceding only 19 runs and took the solitary wicket of King. In the second T20I, besides picking a wicket, he scored a gutsy 31. It is not to be forgotten that only a few weeks ago, he bagged a four-wicket haul and smashed 51 against England at Southampton.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Smart Picks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rovman Powell <\/strong>has managed only 42 runs<strong> <\/strong>in this series, but he will have fond memories of blasting 54 off 34 balls, including 6 fours and 3 sixes against India when the two teams last played at Lauderhill in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bhuvneshwar Kumar<\/strong> might have been a bit expensive by his standards in the previous game, but he was successful in dismissing the dangerous Kyle Mayers and Nicholas Pooran. Like Powell, Bhuvneshwar too had a fruitful visit to Lauderhill in 2019. His figures after two T20Is read 6-0-26-3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rishabh Pant<\/strong>\u2019s 33 off 26 was crucial in helping India get over the winning line at St Kitts. Given the ongoing musical chairs for the opening slot, he is always going to be a potential candidate. If he gets the nod, we know what he is capable of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From whatever little we have seen of <strong>Brandon King<\/strong> in T20Is, he tends to blow hot and cold. His recent scores in the format read 20, 68, 7, 57, and 22.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, <strong>Nicholas Pooran<\/strong> too has been mercurial in his temperament. He hasn\u2019t set the stage on fire yet in this series but has the ability to cut loose at any given point. He has registered 4 half-centuries in 13 T20Is against India.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After picking a six-wicket haul in the second match, <strong>Obed McCoy<\/strong> went wicketless in the last one. That said, he remains the No.1 strike bowler for his side with both the new and old ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although <strong>Arshdeep Singh<\/strong> has only played four T20Is till now, he is yet to go wicketless. He has taken 4 wickets and has kept his economy under 7 RPO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kyle Mayers<\/strong> was the dark horse in the last game. His knock of 73 made a huge difference in fantasy leagues. If West Indies are to level the series, they will need another sparkling innings from the opener.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also Read:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/fantasy-sports\/cricket-teams\/india\/\">India squad for t20 world cup<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/asia-cup-2022-full-schedule-venue-teams-and-format\/\">Asia Cup 2022 Schedule<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.my11circle.com\/blog\/how-to-win-fantasy-cricket-mega-contests\/\">How to win fantasy mega contests<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Form Concern<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Avesh Khan<\/strong> has been visibly struggling on this tour of the Caribbean.

Although the hosts have started to show more intent and promise with the bat over the past two games, they find themselves in a situation where even a slight slip-up can cost them the series. Meanwhile, India pretty much continue to tick all the right boxes despite the rotation policy. They will fancy their chances of wrapping up the deal before the final match.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-left \"\n    data-id=\"7622\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: px; height: px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Based on recent performances, overall impact, and credit points, we have opted for a fantasy cricket team.
