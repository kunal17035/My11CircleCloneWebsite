					<description><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan were annihilated in the Test series. They could not tackle the lateral movement produced on the South African wickets. In their defence, Duanne Olivier was unplayable, that he sniped absolute jaffa of a delivery every now and then. His fellow pacers – Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, and Vernon Philander – bowled well in tandem [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan have yet again proven that they are a force to reckon with in limited-overs. They are the No. 1 team in T20Is and have been peering upwards in ODIs since their triumph in the 2017 Champions Trophy. A win in the fifth and final match against South Africa will hand them their second ODI [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I would never bet on a debutant. I would add him in my fantasy team in case I run out of credit points but would neither make him my captain nor vice-captain. What are the odds that he or she will shine in first match? None. Mayank Agarwal proved me wrong during the 2018-19 Border-Gavaskar [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The old-timers have been rising to the occasion in 2019. It was MS Dhoni who took his team to victory in the final ODI against Australia and then, the next day, Mohammad Hafeez played an innings of substance and finished things off in style in the first ODI between South Africa and Pakistan. Dhoni is [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>South Africa blanked Pakistan 3-0 in Tests and jumped to the second spot in the ICC Rankings, and now, they have an opportunity to shoot up to the third rank if they, again, topple Pakistan in ODIs. However, Pakistan are a different team when they don coloured clothing. Before the 2017 Champions Trophy, a tournament [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The first Test took 8 sessions to wind up and the second took a session and half more. Blame Pakistan’s abysmal batting performance that the contests have been short and one-sided, and going by the average scores at The Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg, it will be even more difficult for them to rise from the [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The first Test took only 8 sessions to produce a result. Dale Steyn was supposed to take the centre stage. He did though, but only for a wicket, the one that took him past Shaun Pollock’s tally and made him the highest-wicket taker for South Africa in the format. Kagiso Rabada lifted him on his [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka, in their own den, blanked South Africa 2-0 in July this year. Since then, South Africa have not played any Test cricket. Before that, they had drubbed India 2-1 and Australia 3-1 at home. Pakistan too come from a defeat. They lost to New Zealand 1-2, their only second Test series defeat in [&#8230;]</p>
