				<li>If you are new to the world of fantasy games and want to explore it, join our ‘Practice’ contests. Here, you do not have to pay an entry fee. Play for free and challenge other contestants.</li>
				<li>If you want to win prize money, discover various contests such as Mega, Beat the Expert, Beat the Score, Head to head etc.</li>

				<li>Your final score will be updated once the match is over. Go to ‘Matches’ > ‘Completed’ to check your team’s points and rankings.</li>
				<li>The amount you win depends on the performance of players chosen by you, and it will reflect in your My11Circle account after 4 hours of the match being in completed state.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>My11Circle</li>

					</ul>
				
				</li>
			</ul>


			<p><strong class="title"><a name="whatarerules"></a>2. What are the rules to create a team?</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create your Fantasy Team by selecting 11 players with the help of the 100 credit points.</li>
				<li>You can select a maximum of 7 players (Cricket & Football) and 5 players (Kabaddi) from one squad. Let’s say, there’s a match between India and Australia: if you select 7 players from India, you can draft in only 4 players from Australia or vice versa.</li>
				<li><strong>Cricket</strong>: You can select 1 to 4 Wicket Keepers, 1 to 6 Batsmen, 1 to 6 All Rounders and 1 to 6 Bowlers.</li>
				<li><strong>Football</strong>: You can select 1 Goalkeeper, 3 to 5 Defenders, 3 to 5 Midfielders  and 1 to 3 Forwards.</li>
				<li>For matches that go live from 17th October 17:00 IST onwards, this will change to 1 to 2 Goalkeepers, 1 to 6 Defenders, 1 to 6 Midfielders and 1 to 4 Forwards.</li>
				<li>Among the players in your chosen XI, you can assign a captain and a vice-captain.</li>
				<li><strong>Kabaddi:</strong> You can select 1 to 2 Goalkeepers, 1 to 6 Defenders, 1 to 6 Midfielders and 1 to 4 Forwards.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong class="title"><a name="importance"></a>3. What is the importance of a captain and vice-captain?</strong></p>
			<p>The captain and vice-captain you choose for your team are the ones you predict to be the best and second-best players of the match respectively. While the captain bags twice the points for his performance, the vice-captain earns 1.5 times the points.</p>
			<p>Put your analytical skills to good use to earn these bonus points.</p>
			
 			
			<p><strong class="title"><a name="createmultiple"></a>4. How to create multiple teams?</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Select the match you created your fantasy team for.</li>
				<li>Go to ‘Create New Team’ at the bottom and create multiple teams.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<p><strong class="title"><a name="joinacontest"></a>5. How to join a contest?</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Go to ‘Upcoming Matches’ and select a match you’d like to play for.</li>
				<li>Scan through various contests, such as:</li>
				<li><strong>Cash contests</strong>
					<p>There are various types of contests that help you win cash prizes: Mega, Beat the Expert, Beat the Score, Head to head etc.</p>
					<p>These contests have a fixed entry fee designed by our management team. Although you can create teams for free, you’ll have to pay an entry fee when you join a contest. For example, you have to pay three entry fees if you join a contest with three teams.</p>
					<p>You can also create cash private contests (under ‘Private Contests’) and compete amongst your friends.</p>
					<p>It is you who decides the entry fees and cash prizes for the Private contests.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><strong>Practice contests</strong>
					<p>If you are new to the world of fantasy games and want to explore it, you may play the Practice contests. Here, you do not have to pay an entry fee. Play for free and see your ranking amongst the best of the fantasy players.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><strong class="title"><a name="eachcontest"></a>6. Information available for each contest?</strong></p>
			<p>Here’s what you need to know to join our contests:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Total winnings</strong>
					<p>Total winnings for a particular contest is distributed among the winners who are finalised on the basis of their rankings.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><strong>Winners</strong>
					<p>This is the total number of proposed winners in a contest. The number of winners is directly proportional to the number of teams joining the contest.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><strong>Entry fee</strong>
					<p>This is the entry fee which needs to be paid to join a contest. The entry fee can be cash, ticket, or free.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><strong>Prize breakup</strong>
					<p>This is the prize that is distributed depending on the ranks achieved by the teams. Once a match goes live, the prize breakup is updated based on the number of teams that have joined the contest.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><strong>Teams joined/Contest Size</strong>
					<p>This indicates the number of teams that have joined the contest on a real time basis, also displaying the maximum number of teams allowed to join the contest.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><strong>‘G’ - Guaranteed symbol</strong>
					<p>This symbol indicates whether a contest is guaranteed or not. If a contest is guaranteed, it means that the prize for a particular rank is guaranteed, although the number of prizes vary as and when more teams join the contest.</p>
				</li>

					He had 1 assist → 10 pts.<br>
					He completed 30 passes → 3 pts.<br>
					He did not concede any goal and got a clean sheet → 15 pts.<br>
					He made 6 crucial saves → 30 pts.	
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Salah is assigned as a vice-captain, meaning his points (58.5) are multiplied 1.5 times:
					<p>He played for 90 mins → 4 pts<br>
					He scored 1 goal → 15 pts<br>

					He got a Yellow Card → -2 pts<br>

			<p><strong class="title"><a name="winner"></a>10. How is the winner decided?</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Winning positions are decided on the basis of ranks achieved by various teams. The ranks are finalised on the basis of points accumulated by teams.</li>
				<li>For example, consider the following contest details: 
					<p>Total winnings - <span class="title"><strong>₹3,00,000</strong></span><br>
					Contest Size - <span class="title"><strong>₹200</strong></span><br>
					Winners - <span class="title"><strong>₹100</strong></span><br>
					Entry Fee - <span class="title"><strong>₹2000</strong></span>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Prize breakup:
					<p>Rank 1: <span class="title"><strong>₹1,00,000</strong></span><br>
					Rank 2: <span class="title"><strong>₹60,000</strong></span><br>
					Rank 3: <span class="title"><strong>₹20,000</strong></span><br>
					Rank 4-10: <span class="title"><strong>₹5,000</strong></span><br>
					Rank 11-100: <span class="title"><strong>₹1,000</strong></span>
					</p>
				</li>				
			</ul>
			<p>Once a contest is closed, the prize breakup is recalculated on the basis of the number of teams that have joined the contest. For this example, let’s consider the maximum teams allowed to join the contest.</p>
			
			<p>Once the match finishes, all the teams that had joined will have a fixed rank on the basis of the points they have accumulated.</p>
			
			<p>So, if you had joined this contest and your team achieved a rank between 1 and 100, you are a winner and the amount committed in the prize breakup corresponding to your rank is your winning amount.</p>
			
			<p>Please note that cash prize and rankings are different for different contests.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>You can Withdraw Cash at any time by going to My Account page and clicking on Withdraw Cash.</li>
						<li>You are then asked to enter an amount you would like to withdraw.</li>
						<li>You can only withdraw an amount less than or equal to your Withdrawable Balance. This will be shown to you on the Withdraw Cash page.</li>
						<li>For making a withdrawal, you need to be ID verified. If you are not ID verified, then on placing a withdrawal request you shall be prompted to upload the latest copy of ID proof. Our customer service team will review and verify your uploaded document. You can also get yourself ID verified by uploading ID proof document from Profile section under My accounts.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A TDS certificate will be provided to you 3 months from the winning date, on your registered email address.</p>
					

					<p><strong class="title">What is the minimum amount I can withdraw?</strong></p>
					<p>Minimal withdrawal amount is ₹100.</p>
					
					
					<p><strong class="title">What is the maximum amount I can withdraw?</strong></p>
					<p>You can withdraw all the money in your Withdrawable Account at any time. The balance in your Withdrawable Account includes all your cash winnings, any bonuses you earned as a cash player as well as any deposited amount you have used for playing cash games.</p>
					
					
					<p><strong class="title">What are Deposit and Withdrawable Accounts and how is the balance in each account calculated?</strong></p>
					<p>If you are a cash player on My11Circle, your cash account balance is divided into two Accounts - Deposit Account and Withdrawable Accounts. </p>
					<p>Your Deposit Account balance consists of all the amount you have deposited but have not yet played cash games for. Your Withdrawable Account balance includes all your cash winnings, as well as any deposited amount you have used for playing cash games. Every time you play a cash game, the amount used to play that game is credited to your Withdrawable Account. </p>
					<p>The Deposit Account balance and the Withdrawable Account balance together make your total Cash balance. You can play cash games on My11Circle with any amount up to your total Cash balance.</p>
					<p>Let us see some examples. Assume that your <strong>Deposit Account balance is ₹100</strong> and your <strong>Withdrawable Account balance is ₹400 (total balance = ₹500) . You make a deposit of ₹50 in My11Circle</strong>.</p>
					<p>The entire deposit is credited to your Deposit Account. Thus, your Deposit Account balance is now ₹150 ( ₹100 + ₹50) and your Withdrawable Account balance remains at ₹400. Your total balance is ₹550.</p>
					
					
					<p><strong class="title">You play a contest</strong></p>
					<p>Let us say you play a cash contest with an entry fee of ₹100 and win ₹500. The ₹500 that you won becomes a part of your Withdrawable Account. ₹100 is deducted from your Deposit Account as entry fees. Thus, your Deposit Account balance will now be ₹0 ( ₹100 - ₹100) and your Withdrawable Account balance will now be ₹900 ( ₹400 + ₹500). Your total Balance is ₹900.</p>
					
					
					<p><strong class="title">You claim a Bonus</strong></p>
					<p>Let us say you claimed a Bonus Chunk of ₹50. This will be credited to your Withdrawable Account. Thus, your Withdrawable Account balance is now ₹450 ( ₹400 + ₹50) and your Deposit Account balance remains at ₹100. Your total balance is ₹550.</p>
					
					
					<p><strong class="title">How can I view my Deposit and Withdrawal Account balance?</strong></p>
					<p>You can see your Account Balances in Account Overview under My Accounts.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>a) All payments are sent through Online Transfer facility
							<p>In case of payments through the Online Transfer facility:</p>
							<ul>
								<li> You just need to provide your Bank Account Number and MICR code in order to enable us to process your withdrawal by the online transfer facility. In addition to these if you also provide your IFSC code, Bank Name and Branch Area, we will be able to process your withdrawal much faster. All these details are only to be provided once as from your next withdrawal request, these details shall be auto-filled.</li>
								
								<li>We process Online Transfers on all days except Sunday and Bank Holidays. In case you have provided your IFSC code, Bank Name and Branch Area while placing a withdrawal request, you will receive the withdrawn amount credit within 1-3 days of placing your withdrawal request else it may take up to 5-7 days to credit into your bank account.</li>
							</ul>
						
						</li>
						
						<li>Minimal withdrawal amount
						<p>The minimum amount you can withdraw at any time is ₹100.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>TDS Deductions
						<p>As per law, tax deduction at source (TDS) may be applicable on your winnings. TDS is currently applicable at the rate of 30% on winning above ₹10,000 and the rate of TDS and/or the exemption limit are subject to changes from time to time as required by law.</p>
						
						<p>For example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Suppose you participate in a contest with ₹100/- entry fee and win ₹12,000/- in that contest.</li>
							<li>Since your net winning in that contest is ₹11,900/- (₹12,000/- minus ₹100/-) which is greater than ₹10,000/-, a TDS of 30% will be applicable of the net winning amount (₹11,900/-) and will be deducted from the winning amount (₹12,000/-).</li>
							<li>₹3,570/- (₹11,900 x 30%) will be deducted from your winning amount and your account will be credited with ₹8,430/- (₹12,000/- minus ₹3,570/-).</li>
							<li>A TDS certificate will be provided to you 3 months from the winning date, on your registered email address.</li>
							<li>If you have an amount less than ₹100 and would like to withdraw, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@My11Circle.com">support@My11Circle.com</a>.</li>

					<p>Note that Bonus Cash cannot be withdrawn and can only be used to join contests on My11Circle or buy boosters.</p>

					<p>You can spend your earned Bonus Cash in 2 ways:</p>
					<ol>
					<li>Purchasing Boosters (Winning Multiplier)
						<ul>

					<p><img src="../rcmg.in/fantasy/landingimg/acquistion/help-bonus-cash/bonus-cash.jpg" class="account-summ"></p>
					<p><strong>What is a booster?</strong></p>
					<p>Booster is like a superpower you can unlock using your Bonus Cash. We are currently offering 4 boosters: 2x Multiplier, 3x Multiplier, 4x Multiplier and 5x Multiplier. You can apply this on any team in the applicable contest and it will multiply your winnings. For example, if you apply a 3x Multiplier on a team and it wins <strong>&#8377;100</strong>, we will give you <strong>3 x</strong> <strong>&#8377;100</strong> = <strong>&#8377;300</strong>.</p>
					<p>All the boosters come with a cap on the max payout, which can be seen on the contest detail screen.</p>
					<p><strong>What happens when a contest joined partially with Bonus Cash gets abandoned?</strong></p>
					<p>When a contest gets abandoned, the amount of Bonus Cash you have spent to join that contest will be returned to you. You will be able to see this amount of Bonus Cash in your balance after the contest abandonment process has been completed.</p>
					<p><strong>What if the contest on which I applied the booster gets abandoned?</strong></p>
					<p>When a contest gets abandoned, the Bonus Cash you spent on any booster in that contest will get refunded back to you. You will be able to see this amount of Bonus Cash in your balance after the contest abandonment process has been completed.</p>
					<p><strong>Can I remove a booster I have applied to a team?</strong></p>
					<p>Once a booster is applied to a team in a contest, you cannot remove it. However, you can always switch your team. The booster will then be applied to the newly switched team.</p>
					<p><strong>How much Bonus Cash can I use for joining a contest?</strong></p>
					<p>The amount of Bonus Cash you can use for joining a contest can be seen on the contest card.</p>
					<p><strong>How can I apply a booster?</strong></p>
					<p>The contests on which you can apply boosters will have a visible marker on the card itself.<br>
